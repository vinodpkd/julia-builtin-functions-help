```
!(x)
```

Boolean not. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if `x` is `missing`.

See also [`~`](@ref) for bitwise not.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> !true
false

julia> !false
true

julia> !missing
missing

julia> .![true false true]
1×3 BitMatrix:
 0  1  0
```

```
!f::Function
```

Predicate function negation: when the argument of `!` is a function, it returns a function which computes the boolean negation of `f`.

See also [`∘`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0: |x-y| < δ ⇒ |f(x)-f(y)| < ε"
"∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0: |x-y| < δ ⇒ |f(x)-f(y)| < ε"

julia> filter(isletter, str)
"εδxyδfxfyε"

julia> filter(!isletter, str)
"∀  > 0, ∃  > 0: |-| <  ⇒ |()-()| < "
```
```
!=(x, y)
≠(x,y)
```

Not-equals comparison operator. Always gives the opposite answer as [`==`](@ref).

# Implementation

New types should generally not implement this, and rely on the fallback definition `!=(x,y) = !(x==y)` instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 != 2
true

julia> "foo" ≠ "foo"
false
```
```
f ∘ g
```

Compose functions: i.e. `(f ∘ g)(args...; kwargs...)` means `f(g(args...; kwargs...))`. The `∘` symbol can be entered in the Julia REPL (and most editors, appropriately configured) by typing `\circ<tab>`.

Function composition also works in prefix form: `∘(f, g)` is the same as `f ∘ g`. The prefix form supports composition of multiple functions: `∘(f, g, h) = f ∘ g ∘ h` and splatting `∘(fs...)` for composing an iterable collection of functions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Multiple function composition requires at least Julia 1.4.


!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Composition of one function ∘(f) requires at least Julia 1.5.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using keyword arguments requires at least Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> map(uppercase∘first, ["apple", "banana", "carrot"])
3-element Vector{Char}:
 'A': ASCII/Unicode U+0041 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
 'B': ASCII/Unicode U+0042 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
 'C': ASCII/Unicode U+0043 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> fs = [
           x -> 2x
           x -> x/2
           x -> x-1
           x -> x+1
       ];

julia> ∘(fs...)(3)
3.0
```

See also [`ComposedFunction`](@ref), [`!f::Function`](@ref).


```
!=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`!=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y != x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(!=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
!==(x, y)
≢(x,y)
```

Always gives the opposite answer as [`===`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2];

julia> a ≢ b
true

julia> a ≢ a
false
```
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
x & y
```

Bitwise and. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `true`. Add parentheses for function application form: `(&)(x, y)`.

See also: [`|`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`&&`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 & 10
0

julia> 4 & 12
4

julia> true & missing
missing

julia> false & missing
false
```
```
A'
adjoint(A)
```

Lazy adjoint (conjugate transposition). Note that `adjoint` is applied recursively to elements.

For number types, `adjoint` returns the complex conjugate, and therefore it is equivalent to the identity function for real numbers.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> adjoint(A)
2×2 adjoint(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3-2im  8-7im
 9-2im  4-6im

julia> x = [3, 4im]
2-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 3 + 0im
 0 + 4im

julia> x'x
25 + 0im
```
```
*(s::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, t::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}...) -> AbstractString
```

Concatenate strings and/or characters, producing a [`String`](@ref). This is equivalent to calling the [`string`](@ref) function on the arguments. Concatenation of built-in string types always produces a value of type `String` but other string types may choose to return a string of a different type as appropriate.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Hello " * "world"
"Hello world"

julia> 'j' * "ulia"
"julia"
```

```
*(s::Regex, t::Union{Regex,AbstractString,AbstractChar}) -> Regex
*(s::Union{Regex,AbstractString,AbstractChar}, t::Regex) -> Regex
```

Concatenate regexes, strings and/or characters, producing a [`Regex`](@ref). String and character arguments must be matched exactly in the resulting regex, meaning that the contained characters are devoid of any special meaning (they are quoted with "\Q" and "\E").

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"Hello|Good bye" * ' ' * "world", "Hello world")
RegexMatch("Hello world")

julia> r = r"a|b" * "c|d"
r"(?:a|b)\Qc|d\E"

julia> match(r, "ac") == nothing
true

julia> match(r, "ac|d")
RegexMatch("ac|d")
```

```
*(x, y...)
```

Multiplication operator. `x*y*z*...` calls this function with all arguments, i.e. `*(x, y, z, ...)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 2 * 7 * 8
112

julia> *(2, 7, 8)
112
```

```
*(A::AbstractMatrix, B::AbstractMatrix)
```

Matrix multiplication.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1 1; 0 1] * [1 0; 1 1]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 1  1
```

```
*(A, B::AbstractMatrix, C)
A * B * C * D
```

Chained multiplication of 3 or 4 matrices is done in the most efficient sequence, based on the sizes of the arrays. That is, the number of scalar multiplications needed for `(A * B) * C` (with 3 dense matrices) is compared to that for `A * (B * C)` to choose which of these to execute.

If the last factor is a vector, or the first a transposed vector, then it is efficient to deal with these first. In particular `x' * B * y` means `(x' * B) * y` for an ordinary column-major `B::Matrix`. Unlike `dot(x, B, y)`, this allocates an intermediate array.

If the first or last factor is a number, this will be fused with the matrix multiplication, using 5-arg [`mul!`](@ref).

See also [`muladd`](@ref), [`dot`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    These optimisations require at least Julia 1.7.

```
+(x, y...)
```

Addition operator. `x+y+z+...` calls this function with all arguments, i.e. `+(x, y, z, ...)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 1 + 20 + 4
25

julia> +(1, 20, 4)
25
```

```
dt::Date + t::Time -> DateTime
```

The addition of a `Date` with a `Time` produces a `DateTime`. The hour, minute, second, and millisecond parts of the `Time` are used along with the year, month, and day of the `Date` to create the new `DateTime`. Non-zero microseconds or nanoseconds in the `Time` type will result in an `InexactError` being thrown.
```
-(x)
```

Unary minus operator.

See also: [`abs`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> -1
-1

julia> -(2)
-2

julia> -[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1  -2
 -3  -4
```

```
-(x, y)
```

Subtraction operator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 2 - 3
-1

julia> -(2, 4.5)
-2.5
```
```
/(x, y)
```

Right division operator: multiplication of `x` by the inverse of `y` on the right. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 1/2
0.5

julia> 4/2
2.0

julia> 4.5/2
2.25
```

```
A / B
```

Matrix right-division: `A / B` is equivalent to `(B' \ A')'` where [`\`](@ref) is the left-division operator. For square matrices, the result `X` is such that `A == X*B`.

See also: [`rdiv!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Float64[1 4 5; 3 9 2]; B = Float64[1 4 2; 3 4 2; 8 7 1];

julia> X = A / B
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 -0.65   3.75  -1.2
  3.25  -2.75   1.0

julia> isapprox(A, X*B)
true

julia> isapprox(X, A*pinv(B))
true
```
```
//(num, den)
```

Divide two integers or rational numbers, giving a [`Rational`](@ref) result.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 // 5
3//5

julia> (3 // 5) // (2 // 1)
3//10
```
```
Colon()
```

Colons (:) are used to signify indexing entire objects or dimensions at once.

Very few operations are defined on Colons directly; instead they are converted by [`to_indices`](@ref) to an internal vector type (`Base.Slice`) to represent the collection of indices they span before being used.

The singleton instance of `Colon` is also a function used to construct ranges; see [`:`](@ref).
```
<(x, y)
```

Less-than comparison operator. Falls back to [`isless`](@ref). Because of the behavior of floating-point NaN values, this operator implements a partial order.

# Implementation

New numeric types with a canonical partial order should implement this function for two arguments of the new type. Types with a canonical total order should implement [`isless`](@ref) instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' < 'b'
true

julia> "abc" < "abd"
true

julia> 5 < 3
false
```

```
<(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y < x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
<:(T1, T2)
```

Subtype operator: returns `true` if and only if all values of type `T1` are also of type `T2`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Float64 <: AbstractFloat
true

julia> Vector{Int} <: AbstractArray
true

julia> Matrix{Float64} <: Matrix{AbstractFloat}
false
```
```
<<(x, n)
```

Left bit shift operator, `x << n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted left by `n` bits, filling with `0`s. This is equivalent to `x * 2^n`. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x >> -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(3) << 2
12

julia> bitstring(Int8(3))
"00000011"

julia> bitstring(Int8(12))
"00001100"
```

See also [`>>`](@ref), [`>>>`](@ref), [`exp2`](@ref), [`ldexp`](@ref).

```
<<(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Left bit shift operator, `B << n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `B` with elements shifted `n` positions backwards, filling with `false` values. If `n < 0`, elements are shifted forwards. Equivalent to `B >> -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> B = BitVector([true, false, true, false, false])
5-element BitVector:
 1
 0
 1
 0
 0

julia> B << 1
5-element BitVector:
 0

julia> B << -1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 1
 0
```
```
<=(x, y)
≤(x,y)
```

Less-than-or-equals comparison operator. Falls back to `(x < y) | (x == y)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' <= 'b'
true

julia> 7 ≤ 7 ≤ 9
true

julia> "abc" ≤ "abc"
true

julia> 5 <= 3
false
```

```
<=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y <= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
==(x, y)
```

Generic equality operator. Falls back to [`===`](@ref). Should be implemented for all types with a notion of equality, based on the abstract value that an instance represents. For example, all numeric types are compared by numeric value, ignoring type. Strings are compared as sequences of characters, ignoring encoding. For collections, `==` is generally called recursively on all contents, though other properties (like the shape for arrays) may also be taken into account.

This operator follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers: `0.0 == -0.0` and `NaN != NaN`.

The result is of type `Bool`, except when one of the operands is [`missing`](@ref), in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)). For collections, `missing` is returned if at least one of the operands contains a `missing` value and all non-missing values are equal. Use [`isequal`](@ref) or [`===`](@ref) to always get a `Bool` result.

# Implementation

New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.

[`isequal`](@ref) falls back to `==`, so new methods of `==` will be used by the [`Dict`](@ref) type to compare keys. If your type will be used as a dictionary key, it should therefore also implement [`hash`](@ref).

If some type defines `==`, [`isequal`](@ref), and [`isless`](@ref) then it should also implement [`<`](@ref) to ensure consistency of comparisons.

```
==(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`==`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y == x`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(==)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
==(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether two strings are equal character by character (technically, Unicode code point by code point).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "abc" == "abc"
true

julia> "abc" == "αβγ"
false
```
```
>(x, y)
```

Greater-than comparison operator. Falls back to `y < x`.

# Implementation

Generally, new types should implement [`<`](@ref) instead of this function, and rely on the fallback definition `>(x, y) = y < x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' > 'b'
false

julia> 7 > 3 > 1
true

julia> "abc" > "abd"
false

julia> 5 > 3
true
```

```
>(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`>`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y > x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(>)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
>:(T1, T2)
```

Supertype operator, equivalent to `T2 <: T1`.
```
>=(x, y)
≥(x,y)
```

Greater-than-or-equals comparison operator. Falls back to `y <= x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' >= 'b'
false

julia> 7 ≥ 7 ≥ 3
true

julia> "abc" ≥ "abc"
true

julia> 5 >= 3
true
```

```
>=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`>=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y >= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(>=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
>>(x, n)
```

Right bit shift operator, `x >> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted right by `n` bits, where `n >= 0`, filling with `0`s if `x >= 0`, `1`s if `x < 0`, preserving the sign of `x`. This is equivalent to `fld(x, 2^n)`. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x << -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(13) >> 2
3

julia> bitstring(Int8(13))
"00001101"

julia> bitstring(Int8(3))
"00000011"

julia> Int8(-14) >> 2
-4

julia> bitstring(Int8(-14))
"11110010"

julia> bitstring(Int8(-4))
"11111100"
```

See also [`>>>`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

```
>>(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Right bit shift operator, `B >> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `B` with elements shifted `n` positions forward, filling with `false` values. If `n < 0`, elements are shifted backwards. Equivalent to `B << -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> B = BitVector([true, false, true, false, false])
5-element BitVector:
 1
 0
 1
 0
 0

julia> B >> 1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 1
 0

julia> B >> -1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 0
 0
```
```
>>>(x, n)
```

Unsigned right bit shift operator, `x >>> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted right by `n` bits, where `n >= 0`, filling with `0`s. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x << -n`.

For [`Unsigned`](@ref) integer types, this is equivalent to [`>>`](@ref). For [`Signed`](@ref) integer types, this is equivalent to `signed(unsigned(x) >> n)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(-14) >>> 2
60

julia> bitstring(Int8(-14))
"11110010"

julia> bitstring(Int8(60))
"00111100"
```

[`BigInt`](@ref)s are treated as if having infinite size, so no filling is required and this is equivalent to [`>>`](@ref).

See also [`>>`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

```
>>>(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Unsigned right bitshift operator, `B >>> n`. Equivalent to `B >> n`. See [`>>`](@ref) for details and examples.
```
@MIME_str
```

A convenience macro for writing [`MIME`](@ref) types, typically used when adding methods to [`show`](@ref). For example the syntax `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/html", x::MyType) = ...` could be used to define how to write an HTML representation of `MyType`.
```
@NamedTuple{key1::Type1, key2::Type2, ...}
@NamedTuple begin key1::Type1; key2::Type2; ...; end
```

This macro gives a more convenient syntax for declaring `NamedTuple` types. It returns a `NamedTuple` type with the given keys and types, equivalent to `NamedTuple{(:key1, :key2, ...), Tuple{Type1,Type2,...}}`. If the `::Type` declaration is omitted, it is taken to be `Any`.   The `begin ... end` form allows the declarations to be split across multiple lines (similar to a `struct` declaration), but is otherwise equivalent.

For example, the tuple `(a=3.1, b="hello")` has a type `NamedTuple{(:a, :b),Tuple{Float64,String}}`, which can also be declared via `@NamedTuple` as:

```jldoctest
julia> @NamedTuple{a::Float64, b::String}
NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Float64, String}}

julia> @NamedTuple begin
           a::Float64
           b::String
       end
NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Float64, String}}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.5.

```
@__DIR__ -> AbstractString
```

Expand to a string with the absolute path to the directory of the file containing the macrocall. Return the current working directory if run from a REPL or if evaluated by `julia -e <expr>`.
```
@__FILE__ -> AbstractString
```

Expand to a string with the path to the file containing the macrocall, or an empty string if evaluated by `julia -e <expr>`. Return `nothing` if the macro was missing parser source information. Alternatively see [`PROGRAM_FILE`](@ref).
```
@__LINE__ -> Int
```

Expand to the line number of the location of the macrocall. Return `0` if the line number could not be determined.
```
@__MODULE__ -> Module
```

Get the `Module` of the toplevel eval, which is the `Module` code is currently being read from.
```
@. expr
```

Convert every function call or operator in `expr` into a "dot call" (e.g. convert `f(x)` to `f.(x)`), and convert every assignment in `expr` to a "dot assignment" (e.g. convert `+=` to `.+=`).

If you want to *avoid* adding dots for selected function calls in `expr`, splice those function calls in with `$`.  For example, `@. sqrt(abs($sort(x)))` is equivalent to `sqrt.(abs.(sort(x)))` (no dot for `sort`).

(`@.` is equivalent to a call to `@__dot__`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1.0:3.0; y = similar(x);

julia> @. y = x + 3 * sin(x)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 3.5244129544236893

 3.4233600241796016
```
```
@allocated
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the total number of bytes allocated during evaluation of the expression.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@elapsed`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @allocated rand(10^6)
8000080
```
No documentation found.

Binding `@allocations` does not exist.
```
@assert cond [text]
```

Throw an [`AssertionError`](@ref) if `cond` is `false`. Preferred syntax for writing assertions. Message `text` is optionally displayed upon assertion failure.

!!! warning
    An assert might be disabled at various optimization levels. Assert should therefore only be used as a debugging tool and not used for authentication verification (e.g., verifying passwords), nor should side effects needed for the function to work correctly be used inside of asserts.


# Examples

```jldoctest

```
@async
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) and add it to the local machine's scheduler queue.

Values can be interpolated into `@async` via `$`, which copies the value directly into the constructed underlying closure. This allows you to insert the *value* of a variable, isolating the asynchronous code from changes to the variable's value in the current task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Interpolating values via `$` is available as of Julia 1.4.

```
@atomic var
@atomic order ex
```

Mark `var` or `ex` as being performed atomically, if `ex` is a supported expression.

```
@atomic a.b.x = new
@atomic a.b.x += addend
@atomic :release a.b.x = new
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x += addend
```

Perform the store operation expressed on the right atomically and return the new value.

With `=`, this operation translates to a `setproperty!(a.b, :x, new)` call. With any operator also, this operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, +, addend)[2]` call.

```
@atomic a.b.x max arg2
@atomic a.b.x + arg2
@atomic max(a.b.x, arg2)
@atomic :acquire_release max(a.b.x, arg2)
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x + arg2
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x max arg2
```

Perform the binary operation expressed on the right atomically. Store the result into the field in the first argument and return the values `(old, new)`.

This operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, func, arg2)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

```
@atomicreplace a.b.x expected => desired
@atomicreplace :sequentially_consistent a.b.x expected => desired
@atomicreplace :sequentially_consistent :monotonic a.b.x expected => desired
```

Perform the conditional replacement expressed by the pair atomically, returning the values `(old, success::Bool)`. Where `success` indicates whether the replacement was completed.

This operation translates to a `replaceproperty!(a.b, :x, expected, desired)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

```jldoctest
julia> mutable struct Atomic{T}; @atomic x::T; end

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.7.

```
@atomicswap a.b.x = new
@atomicswap :sequentially_consistent a.b.x = new
```

Stores `new` into `a.b.x` and returns the old value of `a.b.x`.

This operation translates to a `swapproperty!(a.b, :x, new)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

@b_str
```

Create an immutable byte (`UInt8`) vector using string syntax.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = b"12\x01\x02"
4-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x31
 0x32
 0x01
 0x02

julia> v[2]
0x32
```
```
@big_str str
@big_str(str)
```

Parse a string into a [`BigInt`](@ref) or [`BigFloat`](@ref), and throw an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid number. For integers `_` is allowed in the string as a separator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big"123_456"
123456

julia> big"7891.5"
7891.5
```
```
@boundscheck(blk)
```

Annotates the expression `blk` as a bounds checking block, allowing it to be elided by [`@inbounds`](@ref).

!!! note
    The function in which `@boundscheck` is written must be inlined into its caller in order for `@inbounds` to have effect.


# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> @inline function g(A, i)
           @boundscheck checkbounds(A, i)
           return "accessing ($A)[$i]"
       end;

julia> f1() = return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f2() = @inbounds return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f1()

```

!!! warning
    The `@boundscheck` annotation allows you, as a library writer, to opt-in to allowing *other code* to remove your bounds checks with [`@inbounds`](@ref). As noted there, the caller must verify—using information they can access—that their accesses are valid before using `@inbounds`. For indexing into your [`AbstractArray`](@ref) subclasses, for example, this involves checking the indices against its [`axes`](@ref). Therefore, `@boundscheck` annotations should only be added to a [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) implementation after you are certain its behavior is correct.

```
@ccall library.function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall $function_pointer(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
```

Call a function in a C-exported shared library, specified by `library.function_name`, where `library` is a string constant or literal. The library may be omitted, in which case the `function_name` is resolved in the current process. Alternatively, `@ccall` may also be used to call a function pointer `$function_pointer`, such as one returned by `dlsym`.

Each `argvalue` to `@ccall` is converted to the corresponding `argtype`, by automatic insertion of calls to `unsafe_convert(argtype, cconvert(argtype, argvalue))`. (See also the documentation for [`unsafe_convert`](@ref Base.unsafe_convert) and [`cconvert`](@ref Base.cconvert) for further details.) In most cases, this simply results in a call to `convert(argtype, argvalue)`.

# Examples

```
@ccall strlen(s::Cstring)::Csize_t
```

This calls the C standard library function:

```
size_t strlen(char *)
```

with a Julia variable named `s`. See also `ccall`.

Varargs are supported with the following convention:

```
@ccall printf("%s = %d"::Cstring ; "foo"::Cstring, foo::Cint)::Cint
```

The semicolon is used to separate required arguments (of which there must be at least one) from variadic arguments.

Example using an external library:

```
# C signature of g_uri_escape_string:
# char *g_uri_escape_string(const char *unescaped, const char *reserved_chars_allowed, gboolean allow_utf8);

const glib = "libglib-2.0"
@ccall glib.g_uri_escape_string(my_uri::Cstring, ":/"::Cstring, true::Cint)::Cstring
```

The string literal could also be used directly before the function name, if desired `"libglib-2.0".g_uri_escape_string(...`
```
@cfunction(callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> Ptr{Cvoid}
@cfunction($callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> CFunction
```

Generate a C-callable function pointer from the Julia function `callable` for the given type signature. To pass the return value to a `ccall`, use the argument type `Ptr{Cvoid}` in the signature.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression (although it can include a splat expression). And that these arguments will be evaluated in global scope during compile-time (not deferred until runtime). Adding a '$' in front of the function argument changes this to instead create a runtime closure over the local variable `callable` (this is not supported on all architectures).

See [manual section on ccall and cfunction usage](@ref Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
           return x + y
       end

julia> @cfunction(foo, Int, (Int, Int))
Ptr{Cvoid} @0x000000001b82fcd0
```
```
@cmd str
```

Similar to `cmd`, generate a `Cmd` from the `str` string which represents the shell command(s) to be executed. The [`Cmd`](@ref) object can be run as a process and can outlive the spawning julia process (see `Cmd` for more).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cm = @cmd " echo 1 "
`echo 1`

julia> run(cm)
1
Process(`echo 1`, ProcessExited(0))
```
```
@coalesce(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); missing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @coalesce a f(2) f(3) error("`a` is still missing")
1

julia> b = missing;

julia> b = @coalesce b f(2) f(3) error("`b` is still missing")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: `b` is still missing

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@deprecate old new [export_old=true]
```

Deprecate method `old` and specify the replacement call `new`. Prevent `@deprecate` from exporting `old` by setting `export_old` to `false`. `@deprecate` defines a new method with the same signature as `old`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    As of Julia 1.5, functions defined by `@deprecate` do not print warning when `julia` is run without the `--depwarn=yes` flag set, as the default value of `--depwarn` option is `no`.  The warnings are printed from tests run by `Pkg.test()`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x)
old (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x) false
old (generic function with 1 method)
```
# Documentation

Functions, methods and types can be documented by placing a string before the definition:

```
"""
# The Foo Function
`foo(x)`: Foo the living hell out of `x`.
"""
foo(x) = ...
```

The `@doc` macro can be used directly to both set and retrieve documentation / metadata. The macro has special parsing so that the documented object may occur on the next line:

```
@doc "blah"
function foo() ...
```

By default, documentation is written as Markdown, but any object can be used as the first argument.

## Documenting objects after they are defined

You can document an object after its definition by

```
@doc "foo" function_to_doc
@doc "bar" TypeToDoc
```

For macros, the syntax is `@doc "macro doc" :(@Module.macro)` or `@doc "macro doc" :(string_macro"")` for string macros. Without the quote `:()` the expansion of the macro will be documented.

## Retrieving Documentation

You can retrieve docs for functions, macros and other objects as follows:

```
@doc foo
@doc @time
@doc md""
```

## Functions & Methods

Placing documentation before a method definition (e.g. `function foo() ...` or `foo() = ...`) will cause that specific method to be documented, as opposed to the whole function. Method docs are concatenated together in the order they were defined to provide docs for the function.
```
@elapsed
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the number of seconds it took to execute as a floating-point number.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@elapsed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@elapsed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @elapsed sleep(0.3)
0.301391426
```
```
@enum EnumName[::BaseType] value1[=x] value2[=y]
```

Create an `Enum{BaseType}` subtype with name `EnumName` and enum member values of `value1` and `value2` with optional assigned values of `x` and `y`, respectively. `EnumName` can be used just like other types and enum member values as regular values, such as

# Examples

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> @enum Fruit apple=1 orange=2 kiwi=3

julia> f(x::Fruit) = "I'm a Fruit with value: $(Int(x))"
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(apple)
"I'm a Fruit with value: 1"

julia> Fruit(1)
apple::Fruit = 1
```

Values can also be specified inside a `begin` block, e.g.

```julia
@enum EnumName begin
    value1
    value2
end
```

`BaseType`, which defaults to [`Int32`](@ref), must be a primitive subtype of `Integer`. Member values can be converted between the enum type and `BaseType`. `read` and `write` perform these conversions automatically. In case the enum is created with a non-default `BaseType`, `Integer(value1)` will return the integer `value1` with the type `BaseType`.

To list all the instances of an enum use `instances`, e.g.

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> instances(Fruit)
(apple, orange, kiwi)
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]

    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@eval [mod,] ex
```

Evaluate an expression with values interpolated into it using `eval`. If two arguments are provided, the first is the module to evaluate in.
```
@evalpoly(z, c...)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k z^{k-1} c[k]$ for the coefficients `c[1]`, `c[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `z`.  This macro expands to efficient inline code that uses either Horner's method or, for complex `z`, a more efficient Goertzel-like algorithm.

See also [`evalpoly`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @evalpoly(3, 1, 0, 1)
10

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 0, 1)
5

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 1, 1)
7
```
```
@fastmath expr
```

Execute a transformed version of the expression, which calls functions that may violate strict IEEE semantics. This allows the fastest possible operation, but results are undefined – be careful when doing this, as it may change numerical results.

This sets the [LLVM Fast-Math flags](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags), and corresponds to the `-ffast-math` option in clang. See [the notes on performance annotations](@ref man-performance-annotations) for more details.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @fastmath 1+2
3

julia> @fastmath(sin(3))
0.1411200080598672
```
```
@generated f
```

`@generated` is used to annotate a function which will be generated. In the body of the generated function, only types of arguments can be read (not the values). The function returns a quoted expression evaluated when the function is called. The `@generated` macro should not be used on functions mutating the global scope or depending on mutable elements.

See [Metaprogramming](@ref) for further details.

## Example:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else
               return :(x)
           end
       end
bar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar(4)
16

julia> bar("baz")
"baz"
```
```
@gensym
```

Generates a gensym symbol for a variable. For example, `@gensym x y` is transformed into `x = gensym("x"); y = gensym("y")`.
```
@goto name
```

`@goto name` unconditionally jumps to the statement at the location [`@label name`](@ref).

`@label` and `@goto` cannot create jumps to different top-level statements. Attempts cause an error. To still use `@goto`, enclose the `@label` and `@goto` in a block.
```
@html_str -> Docs.HTML
```

Create an `HTML` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> html"Julia"
HTML{String}("Julia")
```
```
@inbounds(blk)
```

Eliminates array bounds checking within expressions.

In the example below the in-range check for referencing element `i` of array `A` is skipped to improve performance.

```julia
function sum(A::AbstractArray)
    r = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in eachindex(A)
        @inbounds r += A[i]
    end
    return r
end
```

!!! warning
    Using `@inbounds` may return incorrect results/crashes/corruption for out-of-bounds indices. The user is responsible for checking it manually. Only use `@inbounds` when it is certain from the information locally available that all accesses are in bounds.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]

    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@inline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that this function is worth inlining.

Small functions typically do not need the `@inline` annotation, as the compiler does it automatically. By using `@inline` on bigger functions, an extra nudge can be given to the compiler to inline it.

`@inline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@inline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@inline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @inline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.

Give a hint to the compiler that calls within `block` are worth inlining.

```julia
# The compiler will try to inline `f`
@inline f(...)

# The compiler will try to inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@inline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @noinline function explicit_noinline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @inline explicit_noinline(args...) # will be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @noinline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @inline f(a0)  # the compiler will try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)          # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! warning
    Although a callsite annotation will try to force inlining in regardless of the cost model, there are still chances it can't succeed in it. Especially, recursive calls can not be inlined even if they are annotated as `@inline`d.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
@int128_str str

```
@isdefined s -> Bool
```

Tests whether variable `s` is defined in the current scope.

See also [`isdefined`](@ref) for field properties and [`isassigned`](@ref) for array indexes or [`haskey`](@ref) for other mappings.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @isdefined newvar
false

julia> newvar = 1
1

julia> @isdefined newvar
true

julia> function f()
           println(@isdefined x)

       end

```
@label name
```

Labels a statement with the symbolic label `name`. The label marks the end-point of an unconditional jump with [`@goto name`](@ref).
```
lazy"str"
```

Create a [`LazyString`](@ref) using regular string interpolation syntax. Note that interpolations are *evaluated* at LazyString construction time, but *printing* is delayed until the first access to the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    `lazy"str"` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

```
@lock l expr
```

Macro version of `lock(f, l::AbstractLock)` but with `expr` instead of `f` function. Expands to:

```julia
lock(l)
try
    expr
finally
    unlock(l)
end
```

This is similar to using [`lock`](@ref) with a `do` block, but avoids creating a closure and thus can improve the performance.
```
@macroexpand
```

Return equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded).

There are differences between `@macroexpand` and [`macroexpand`](@ref).

  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) takes a keyword argument `recursive`, `@macroexpand` is always recursive. For a non recursive macro version, see [`@macroexpand1`](@ref).
  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) has an explicit `module` argument, `@macroexpand` always expands with respect to the module in which it is called.

This is best seen in the following example:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m()
               1
           end
           function f()
               (@macroexpand(@m),
                macroexpand(M, :(@m)),
                macroexpand(Main, :(@m))
               )
           end
       end
M

julia> macro m()
           2
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> M.f()
(1, 1, 2)
```

With `@macroexpand` the expression expands where `@macroexpand` appears in the code (module `M` in the example). With `macroexpand` the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.
```
@macroexpand1
```

Non recursive version of [`@macroexpand`](@ref).
```
@noinline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline a function.

Small functions are typically inlined automatically. By using `@noinline` on small functions, auto-inlining can be prevented.

`@noinline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@noinline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@noinline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @noinline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@noinline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline the calls within `block`.

```julia
# The compiler will try to not inline `f`
@noinline f(...)

# The compiler will try to not inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@noinline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @inline function explicit_inline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @noinline explicit_inline(args...) # will not be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @inline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @noinline f(a0)  # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)            # the compiler will try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

!!! note
    If the function is trivial (for example returning a constant) it might get inlined anyway.

```
@nospecialize
```

Applied to a function argument name, hints to the compiler that the method should not be specialized for different types of that argument, but instead to use precisely the declared type for each argument. This is only a hint for avoiding excess code generation. Can be applied to an argument within a formal argument list, or in the function body. When applied to an argument, the macro must wrap the entire argument expression. When used in a function body, the macro must occur in statement position and before any code.

When used without arguments, it applies to all arguments of the parent scope. In local scope, this means all arguments of the containing function. In global (top-level) scope, this means all methods subsequently defined in the current module.

Specialization can reset back to the default by using [`@specialize`](@ref).

```julia
function example_function(@nospecialize x)
    ...
end

function example_function(x, @nospecialize(y = 1))
    ...
end

function example_function(x, y, z)
    @nospecialize x y
    ...
end

@nospecialize
f(y) = [x for x in y]
@specialize
```
```
@polly
```

Tells the compiler to apply the polyhedral optimizer Polly to a function.
```
@r_str -> Regex
```

Construct a regex, such as `r"^[a-z]*$"`, without interpolation and unescaping (except for quotation mark `"` which still has to be escaped). The regex also accepts one or more flags, listed after the ending quote, to change its behaviour:

  * `i` enables case-insensitive matching
  * `m` treats the `^` and `$` tokens as matching the start and end of individual lines, as opposed to the whole string.
  * `s` allows the `.` modifier to match newlines.
  * `x` enables "comment mode": whitespace is enabled except when escaped with `\`, and `#` is treated as starting a comment.
  * `a` disables `UCP` mode (enables ASCII mode). By default `\B`, `\b`, `\D`, `\d`, `\S`, `\s`, `\W`, `\w`, etc. match based on Unicode character properties. With this option, these sequences only match ASCII characters.

See [`Regex`](@ref) if interpolation is needed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"a+.*b+.*?d$"ism, "Goodbye,\nOh, angry,\nBad world\n")
RegexMatch("angry,\nBad world")
```

This regex has the first three flags enabled.
```
@raw_str -> String
```

Create a raw string without interpolation and unescaping. The exception is that quotation marks still must be escaped. Backslashes escape both quotation marks and other backslashes, but only when a sequence of backslashes precedes a quote character. Thus, 2n backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes and the end of the literal while 2n+1 backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes followed by a quote character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println(raw"\ $x")
\ $x

julia> println(raw"\"")
"

julia> println(raw"\\\"")
\"

julia> println(raw"\\x \\\"")
\\x \"
```
```
@s_str -> SubstitutionString
```

Construct a substitution string, used for regular expression substitutions.  Within the string, sequences of the form `\N` refer to the Nth capture group in the regex, and `\g<groupname>` refers to a named capture group with name `groupname`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> msg = "#Hello# from Julia";

julia> replace(msg, r"#(.+)# from (?<from>\w+)" => s"FROM: \g<from>; MESSAGE: \1")
"FROM: Julia; MESSAGE: Hello"
```
```
@show exs...
```

Prints one or more expressions, and their results, to `stdout`, and returns the last result.

See also: [`show`](@ref), [`@info`](@ref man-logging), [`println`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = @show 1+2
1 + 2 = 3
3

julia> @show x^2 x/2;
x ^ 2 = 9
x / 2 = 1.5
```
```
@showtime expr
```

Like `@time` but also prints the expression being evaluated for reference.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This macro was added in Julia 1.8.


See also [`@time`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @showtime sleep(1)
sleep(1): 1.002164 seconds (4 allocations: 128 bytes)
```
```
@simd
```

Annotate a `for` loop to allow the compiler to take extra liberties to allow loop re-ordering

!!! warning
    This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia. Incorrect use of the `@simd` macro may cause unexpected results.


The object iterated over in a `@simd for` loop should be a one-dimensional range. By using `@simd`, you are asserting several properties of the loop:

  * It is safe to execute iterations in arbitrary or overlapping order, with special consideration for reduction variables.
  * Floating-point operations on reduction variables can be reordered, possibly causing different results than without `@simd`.

In many cases, Julia is able to automatically vectorize inner for loops without the use of `@simd`. Using `@simd` gives the compiler a little extra leeway to make it possible in more situations. In either case, your inner loop should have the following properties to allow vectorization:

  * The loop must be an innermost loop
  * The loop body must be straight-line code. Therefore, [`@inbounds`](@ref) is   currently needed for all array accesses. The compiler can sometimes turn   short `&&`, `||`, and `?:` expressions into straight-line code if it is safe   to evaluate all operands unconditionally. Consider using the [`ifelse`](@ref)   function instead of `?:` in the loop if it is safe to do so.
  * Accesses must have a stride pattern and cannot be "gathers" (random-index   reads) or "scatters" (random-index writes).
  * The stride should be unit stride.

!!! note
    The `@simd` does not assert by default that the loop is completely free of loop-carried memory dependencies, which is an assumption that can easily be violated in generic code. If you are writing non-generic code, you can use `@simd ivdep for ... end` to also assert that:


  * There exists no loop-carried memory dependencies
  * No iteration ever waits on a previous iteration to make forward progress.
```
@something(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); nothing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @something a f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `a`")
1

julia> b = nothing;

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `b`")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: Unable to find default for `b`
[...]

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) Some(nothing)
f(2)
f(3)

julia> b === nothing
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@specialize
```

Reset the specialization hint for an argument back to the default. For details, see [`@nospecialize`](@ref).
```
@static
```

Partially evaluate an expression at parse time.

For example, `@static Sys.iswindows() ? foo : bar` will evaluate `Sys.iswindows()` and insert either `foo` or `bar` into the expression. This is useful in cases where a construct would be invalid on other platforms, such as a `ccall` to a non-existent function. `@static if Sys.isapple() foo end` and `@static foo <&&,||> bar` are also valid syntax.
```
@sync
```

Wait until all lexically-enclosed uses of `@async`, `@spawn`, `@spawnat` and `@distributed` are complete. All exceptions thrown by enclosed async operations are collected and thrown as a `CompositeException`.
```
@task
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) without executing it, and return the [`Task`](@ref). This only creates a task, and does not run it.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a1() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = @task a1();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
@text_str -> Docs.Text
```

Create a `Text` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> text"Julia"
Julia
```
```
@threadcall((cfunc, clib), rettype, (argtypes...), argvals...)
```

The `@threadcall` macro is called in the same way as [`ccall`](@ref) but does the work in a different thread. This is useful when you want to call a blocking C function without causing the main `julia` thread to become blocked. Concurrency is limited by size of the libuv thread pool, which defaults to 4 threads but can be increased by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable and restarting the `julia` process.

Note that the called function should never call back into Julia.
```
@time expr
@time "description" expr
```

A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations, and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression. Any time spent garbage collecting (gc), compiling new code, or recompiling invalidated code is shown as a percentage.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@time` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@time @eval ...`.

See also [`@showtime`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

!!! note
    For more serious benchmarking, consider the `@btime` macro from the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The option to add a description was introduced in Julia 1.8.

    Recompilation time being shown separately from compilation time was introduced in Julia 1.8


```julia-repl

2: 1.001263 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
3: 1.003676 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
```
```
@timed
```

A macro to execute an expression, and return the value of the expression, elapsed time, total bytes allocated, garbage collection time, and an object with various memory allocation counters.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@timed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@timed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> stats = @timed rand(10^6);

julia> stats.time

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The return type of this macro was changed from `Tuple` to `NamedTuple` in Julia 1.5.

```
@timev expr
@timev "description" expr
```

This is a verbose version of the `@time` macro. It first prints the same information as `@time`, then any non-zero memory allocation counters, and then returns the value of the expression.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

@uint128_str str
@uint128_str(str)
```

`@uint128_str` parses a string into a UInt128. Throws an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid integer.
```
@v_str
```

String macro used to parse a string to a [`VersionNumber`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

julia> v"2.0.1-rc1"
v"2.0.1-rc1"
```
```
@view A[inds...]
```

Transform the indexing expression `A[inds...]` into the equivalent [`view`](@ref) call.

This can only be applied directly to a single indexing expression and is particularly helpful for expressions that include the special `begin` or `end` indexing syntaxes like `A[begin, 2:end-1]` (as those are not supported by the normal [`view`](@ref) function).

Note that `@view` cannot be used as the target of a regular assignment (e.g., `@view(A[1, 2:end]) = ...`), nor would the un-decorated [indexed assignment](@ref man-indexed-assignment) (`A[1, 2:end] = ...`) or broadcasted indexed assignment (`A[1, 2:end] .= ...`) make a copy.  It can be useful, however, for *updating* broadcasted assignments like `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .+= 1` because this is a simple syntax for `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .= @view(A[1, 2:end]) + 1`, and the indexing expression on the right-hand side would otherwise make a copy without the `@view`.

See also [`@views`](@ref) to switch an entire block of code to use views for non-scalar indexing.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = @view A[:, 1]
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4
```
```
@views expression
```

Convert every array-slicing operation in the given expression (which may be a `begin`/`end` block, loop, function, etc.) to return a view. Scalar indices, non-array types, and explicit [`getindex`](@ref) calls (as opposed to `array[...]`) are unaffected.

!!! note
    The `@views` macro only affects `array[...]` expressions that appear explicitly in the given `expression`, not array slicing that occurs in functions called by that code.


!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(3, 3);

julia> @views for row in 1:3
           b = A[row, :]
           b[:] .= row
       end

julia> A
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 3.0  3.0  3.0
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
PipeBuffer(data::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[]; maxsize::Integer = typemax(Int))
```

An [`IOBuffer`](@ref) that allows reading and performs writes by appending. Seeking and truncating are not supported. See [`IOBuffer`](@ref) for the available constructors. If `data` is given, creates a `PipeBuffer` to operate on a data vector, optionally specifying a size beyond which the underlying `Array` may not be grown.
```
\(x, y)
```

Left division operator: multiplication of `y` by the inverse of `x` on the left. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 \ 6
2.0

julia> inv(3) * 6
2.0

julia> A = [4 3; 2 1]; x = [5, 6];

julia> A \ x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0

julia> inv(A) * x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0
```

```
\(A, B)
```

Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices `A` and `B`, the result `X` is such that `A*X == B` when `A` is square. The solver that is used depends upon the structure of `A`.  If `A` is upper or lower triangular (or diagonal), no factorization of `A` is required and the system is solved with either forward or backward substitution. For non-triangular square matrices, an LU factorization is used.

For rectangular `A` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of `A` and a rank estimate of `A` based on the R factor.

When `A` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the `LDLt` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

See also: [`factorize`](@ref), [`pinv`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 0; 1 -2]; B = [32; -4];

julia> X = A \ B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 32.0
 18.0

julia> A * X == B
true
```

```
(\)(F::QRSparse, B::StridedVecOrMat)
```

Solve the least squares problem $\min\|Ax - b\|^2$ or the linear system of equations $Ax=b$ when `F` is the sparse QR factorization of $A$. A basic solution is returned when the problem is underdetermined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse([1,2,4], [1,1,1], [1.0,1.0,1.0], 4, 2)
4×2 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1.0   ⋅
 1.0   ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅
 1.0   ⋅

julia> qr(A)\fill(1.0, 4)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0
```
```
^(x, y)
```

Exponentiation operator. If `x` is a matrix, computes matrix exponentiation.

If `y` is an `Int` literal (e.g. `2` in `x^2` or `-3` in `x^-3`), the Julia code `x^y` is transformed by the compiler to `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y))`, to enable compile-time specialization on the value of the exponent. (As a default fallback we have `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y)) = ^(x,y)`, where usually `^ == Base.^` unless `^` has been defined in the calling namespace.) If `y` is a negative integer literal, then `Base.literal_pow` transforms the operation to `inv(x)^-y` by default, where `-y` is positive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3^5
243

julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> A^3
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 37   54
 81  118
```

```
^(s::Union{AbstractString,AbstractChar}, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a string or character `n` times. This can also be written as `repeat(s, n)`.

See also [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Test "^3
"Test Test Test "
```

```
^(s::Regex, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a regex `n` times.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> r"Test "^2
r"(?:Test ){2}"

julia> match(r"Test "^2, "Test Test ")
RegexMatch("Test Test ")
```

```
^(A::AbstractMatrix, p::Number)
```

2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  26
 0  27
```

```

 2.0  6.0
 0.0  8.0

julia> ℯ^[1 2; 0 3]
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.71828  17.3673
 0.0      20.0855
```
```
__precompile__(isprecompilable::Bool)
```

Specify whether the file calling this function is precompilable, defaulting to `true`. If a module or file is *not* safely precompilable, it should call `__precompile__(false)` in order to throw an error if Julia attempts to precompile it.
```
abs(x)
```

The absolute value of `x`.

When `abs` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when `abs` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when `x == typemin(typeof(x))`, `abs(x) == x < 0`, not `-x` as might be expected.

See also: [`abs2`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref).

# Examples

```
abspath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to an absolute path by joining them together and adding the current directory if necessary. Equivalent to `abspath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
accumulate(op, A; dims::Integer, [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` along the dimension `dims` of `A` (providing `dims` is optional for vectors). An initial value `init` may optionally be provided by a keyword argument. See also [`accumulate!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

For common operations there are specialized variants of `accumulate`, see [`cumsum`](@ref), [`cumprod`](@ref). For a lazy version, see [`Iterators.accumulate`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
accumulate!(op, B, A; [dims], [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` on `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. Providing `dims` is optional for vectors.  If the keyword argument `init` is given, its value is used to instantiate the accumulation.

acos(x)
```

Compute the inverse cosine of `x`, where the output is in radians

```
acos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse cosine. Otherwise, the inverse cosine is determined by using [`log`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_1].

A'
adjoint(A)
```

Lazy adjoint (conjugate transposition). Note that `adjoint` is applied recursively to elements.

For number types, `adjoint` returns the complex conjugate, and therefore it is equivalent to the identity function for real numbers.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims).

ascii(s::AbstractString)
```

Convert a string to `String` type and check that it contains only ASCII data, otherwise throwing an `ArgumentError` indicating the position of the first non-ASCII byte.

See also the [`isascii`](@ref) predicate to filter or replace non-ASCII characters.

# Examples

```jldoctest

```
asec(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix secant of `A`. 
```
asecd(x)
```

Compute the inverse secant of `x`, where the output is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
asech(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic secant of `x`. 

```
asech(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

```
asin(x)
```

Compute the inverse sine of `x`, where the output is in radians.

```
asin(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse sine. Otherwise, the inverse sine is determined by using [`log`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_2].

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_5].

[^AH16_5]: Mary Aprahamian and Nicholas J. Higham, "Matrix Inverse Trigonometric and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions: Theory and Algorithms", MIMS EPrint: 2016.4. [https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577)
```
asyncmap(f, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Uses multiple concurrent tasks to map `f` over a collection (or multiple equal length collections). For multiple collection arguments, `f` is applied elementwise.

`ntasks` specifies the number of tasks to run concurrently. Depending on the length of the collections, if `ntasks` is unspecified, up to 100 tasks will be used for concurrent mapping.

`ntasks` can also be specified as a zero-arg function. In this case, the number of tasks to run in parallel is checked before processing every element and a new task started if the value of `ntasks_func` is greater than the current number of tasks.

If `batch_size` is specified, the collection is processed in batch mode. `f` must then be a function that must accept a `Vector` of argument tuples and must return a vector of results. The input vector will have a length of `batch_size` or less.

The following examples highlight execution in different tasks by returning the `objectid` of the tasks in which the mapping function is executed.

First, with `ntasks` undefined, each element is processed in a different task.

```
julia> tskoid() = objectid(current_task());

julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x6e15e66c75c75853
 0x440f8819a1baa682
 0x9fb3eeadd0c83985
 0xebd3e35fe90d4050
 0x29efc93edce2b961

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)))
5
```

With `ntasks=2` all elements are processed in 2 tasks.

```
julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)))
2
```

With `batch_size` defined, the mapping function needs to be changed to accept an array of argument tuples and return an array of results. `map` is used in the modified mapping function to achieve this.

```
julia> batch_func(input) = map(x->string("args_tuple: ", x, ", element_val: ", x[1], ", task: ", tskoid()), input)
batch_func (generic function with 1 method)

julia> asyncmap(batch_func, 1:5; ntasks=2, batch_size=2)
5-element Array{String,1}:
 "args_tuple: (1,), element_val: 1, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (2,), element_val: 2, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (3,), element_val: 3, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (4,), element_val: 4, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (5,), element_val: 5, task: 9118321258196414413"
```

!!! note
    Currently, all tasks in Julia are executed in a single OS thread co-operatively. Consequently, `asyncmap` is beneficial only when the mapping function involves any I/O - disk, network, remote worker invocation, etc.

```
asyncmap!(f, results, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Like [`asyncmap`](@ref), but stores output in `results` rather than returning a collection.
```
atan(y)
atan(y, x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively.

For one argument, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (1, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

For two arguments, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (*x*, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. This corresponds to a standard [`atan2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function. Note that by convention `atan(0.0,x)` is defined as $\pi$ and `atan(-0.0,x)` is defined as $-\pi$ when `x < 0`.

```
atan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse tangent. Otherwise, the inverse tangent is determined by using [`log`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_3].

  0.5+1.38778e-17im  0.1-2.77556e-17im
 -0.2+6.93889e-17im  0.3-4.16334e-17im
```
```
atand(y)
atand(y,x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively, where the output is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The one-argument method supports square matrix arguments as of Julia 1.7.

```
atanh(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
atanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_6].

```
atexit(f)
```

Register a zero-argument function `f()` to be called at process exit. `atexit()` hooks are called in last in first out (LIFO) order and run before object finalizers.

Exit hooks are allowed to call `exit(n)`, in which case Julia will exit with exit code `n` (instead of the original exit code). If more than one exit hook calls `exit(n)`, then Julia will exit with the exit code corresponding to the last called exit hook that calls `exit(n)`. (Because exit hooks are called in LIFO order, "last called" is equivalent to "first registered".)
```
atreplinit(f)
```

Register a one-argument function to be called before the REPL interface is initialized in interactive sessions; this is useful to customize the interface. The argument of `f` is the REPL object. This function should be called from within the `.julia/config/startup.jl` initialization file.
```
axes(A, d)
```

Return the valid range of indices for array `A` along dimension `d`.

See also [`size`](@ref), and the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A, 2)
Base.OneTo(6)
```

# Usage note

Each of the indices has to be an `AbstractUnitRange{<:Integer}`, but at the same time can be a type that uses custom indices. So, for example, if you need a subset, use generalized indexing constructs like `begin`/`end` or [`firstindex`](@ref)/[`lastindex`](@ref):

```julia
ix = axes(v, 1)
ix[2:end]          # will work for eg Vector, but may fail in general
ix[(begin+1):end]  # works for generalized indexes
```

```
axes(A)
```

Return the tuple of valid indices for array `A`.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A)
(Base.OneTo(5), Base.OneTo(6), Base.OneTo(7))
```
```
backtrace()
```

Get a backtrace object for the current program point.
```
basename(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the file name part of a path.

!!! note
    This function differs slightly from the Unix `basename` program, where trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `$ basename /foo/bar/` returns `bar`, whereas `basename` in Julia returns an empty string `""`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> basename("/home/myuser/example.jl")
"example.jl"

julia> basename("/home/myuser/")
""
```

See also [`dirname`](@ref).
```
big(T::Type)
```

Compute the type that represents the numeric type `T` with arbitrary precision. Equivalent to `typeof(big(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big(Rational)
Rational{BigInt}

julia> big(Float64)
BigFloat

julia> big(Complex{Int})
Complex{BigInt}
```

```
big(x)
```

Convert a number to a maximum precision representation (typically [`BigInt`](@ref) or `BigFloat`). See [`BigFloat`](@ref BigFloat(::Any, rounding::RoundingMode)) for information about some pitfalls with floating-point numbers.
```
bind(chnl::Channel, task::Task)
```

Associate the lifetime of `chnl` with a task. `Channel` `chnl` is automatically closed when the task terminates. Any uncaught exception in the task is propagated to all waiters on `chnl`.

The `chnl` object can be explicitly closed independent of task termination. Terminating tasks have no effect on already closed `Channel` objects.

When a channel is bound to multiple tasks, the first task to terminate will close the channel. When multiple channels are bound to the same task, termination of the task will close all of the bound channels.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:4);

julia> bind(c,task);

julia> for i in c
           @show i
       end;
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4

julia> isopen(c)
false
```

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async (put!(c, 1); error("foo"));

julia> bind(c, task);

julia> take!(c)
1

julia> put!(c, 1);
ERROR: TaskFailedException
Stacktrace:
[...]
    nested task error: foo
[...]
```

```
bind(socket::Union{TCPServer, UDPSocket, TCPSocket}, host::IPAddr, port::Integer; ipv6only=false, reuseaddr=false, kws...)
```

Bind `socket` to the given `host:port`. Note that `0.0.0.0` will listen on all devices.

  * The `ipv6only` parameter disables dual stack mode. If `ipv6only=true`, only an IPv6 stack is created.
  * If `reuseaddr=true`, multiple threads or processes can bind to the same address without error if they all set `reuseaddr=true`, but only the last to bind will receive any traffic.
```
binomial(n::Integer, k::Integer)
```

The *binomial coefficient* $\binom{n}{k}$, being the coefficient of the $k$th term in the polynomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$.

If $n$ is non-negative, then it is the number of ways to choose `k` out of `n` items:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}
$$

where $n!$ is the [`factorial`](@ref) function.

If $n$ is negative, then it is defined in terms of the identity

$$
\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{k-n-1}{k}
$$

See also [`factorial`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> binomial(5, 3)
10

julia> factorial(5) ÷ (factorial(5-3) * factorial(3))
10

julia> binomial(-5, 3)
-35
```

```
bitreverse(x)
```

Reverse the order of bits in integer `x`. `x` must have a fixed bit width, e.g. be an `Int16` or `Int32`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitreverse(0x8080808080808080)

julia> reverse(bitstring(0xa06e)) == bitstring(bitreverse(0xa06e))
true
```
```
bitrotate(x::Base.BitInteger, k::Integer)
```

`bitrotate(x, k)` implements bitwise rotation. It returns the value of `x` with its bits rotated left `k` times. A negative value of `k` will rotate to the right instead.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.

"11001001"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, -2))
"10011100"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 8))

```
```
bitstring(n)
```

A string giving the literal bit representation of a primitive type.

See also [`count_ones`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref), [`digits`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitstring(Int32(4))
"00000000000000000000000000000100"

julia> bitstring(2.2)
"0100000000000001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011010"
```
```
broadcast(f, As...)
```

Broadcast the function `f` over the arrays, tuples, collections, [`Ref`](@ref)s and/or scalars `As`.

Broadcasting applies the function `f` over the elements of the container arguments and the scalars themselves in `As`. Singleton and missing dimensions are expanded to match the extents of the other arguments by virtually repeating the value. By default, only a limited number of types are considered scalars, including `Number`s, `String`s, `Symbol`s, `Type`s, `Function`s and some common singletons like [`missing`](@ref) and [`nothing`](@ref). All other arguments are iterated over or indexed into elementwise.

The resulting container type is established by the following rules:

  * If all the arguments are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns an unwrapped scalar.
  * If at least one argument is a tuple and all others are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns a tuple.
  * All other combinations of arguments default to returning an `Array`, but custom container types can define their own implementation and promotion-like rules to customize the result when they appear as arguments.

A special syntax exists for broadcasting: `f.(args...)` is equivalent to `broadcast(f, args...)`, and nested `f.(g.(args...))` calls are fused into a single broadcast loop.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> string.(("one","two","three","four"), ": ", 1:4)
4-element Vector{String}:
 "one: 1"
 "two: 2"
 "three: 3"
 "four: 4"

```
```
broadcast!(f, dest, As...)
```

Like [`broadcast`](@ref), but store the result of `broadcast(f, As...)` in the `dest` array. Note that `dest` is only used to store the result, and does not supply arguments to `f` unless it is also listed in the `As`, as in `broadcast!(f, A, A, B)` to perform `A[:] = broadcast(f, A, B)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1.0; 0.0]; B = [0.0; 0.0];

julia> broadcast!(+, B, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0

julia> broadcast!(+, A, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0
```
```
bswap(n)
```

Reverse the byte order of `n`.

(See also [`ntoh`](@ref) and [`hton`](@ref) to convert between the current native byte order and big-endian order.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = bswap(0x10203040)
0x40302010

julia> bswap(a)
0x10203040

julia> string(1, base = 2)

julia> string(bswap(1), base = 2)
"100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```
```
bytes2hex(itr) -> String
bytes2hex(io::IO, itr)
```

Convert an iterator `itr` of bytes to its hexadecimal string representation, either returning a `String` via `bytes2hex(itr)` or writing the string to an `io` stream via `bytes2hex(io, itr)`.  The hexadecimal characters are all lowercase.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `bytes2hex` with arbitrary iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `bytes2hex`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> b = hex2bytes(a)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> bytes2hex(b)
"3039"
```
```
bytesavailable(io)
```

Return the number of bytes available for reading before a read from this stream or buffer will block.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> bytesavailable(io)
34
```
```
cat(A...; dims)
```

Concatenate the input arrays along the specified dimensions in the iterable `dims`. For dimensions not in `dims`, all input arrays should have the same size, which will also be the size of the output array along that dimension. For dimensions in `dims`, the size of the output array is the sum of the sizes of the input arrays along that dimension. If `dims` is a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows one to construct block diagonal matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example, `cat(matrices...; dims=(1,2))` builds a block diagonal matrix, i.e. a block matrix with `matrices[1]`, `matrices[2]`, ... as diagonal blocks and matching zero blocks away from the diagonal.

See also [`hcat`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`hvcat`](@ref), [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cat([1 2; 3 4], [pi, pi], fill(10, 2,3,1); dims=2)
2×6×1 Array{Float64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =

 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  1  1  1  1
```
```
catch_backtrace()
```

Get the backtrace of the current exception, for use within `catch` blocks.
```
cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```
```
cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Set the current working directory.

See also: [`pwd`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref), [`mkpath`](@ref), [`mktempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"

julia> cd()

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```

```
cd(f::Function, dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Temporarily change the current working directory to `dir`, apply function `f` and finally return to the original directory.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()

```
ceil([T,] x)
ceil(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
ceil(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`ceil(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is greater than or equal to `x`.

`ceil(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
ceil(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` greater than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-09-01

julia> ceil(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:45:00

julia> ceil(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

```
ceil(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` up to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
3 weeks

julia> ceil(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> ceil(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Cvoid])
```

Obtain a pointer to a global variable in a C-exported shared library, specified exactly as in [`ccall`](@ref). Returns a `Ptr{Type}`, defaulting to `Ptr{Cvoid}` if no `Type` argument is supplied. The values can be read or written by [`unsafe_load`](@ref) or [`unsafe_store!`](@ref), respectively.
```
checkbounds(Bool, A, I...)
```

Return `true` if the specified indices `I` are in bounds for the given array `A`. Subtypes of `AbstractArray` should specialize this method if they need to provide custom bounds checking behaviors; however, in many cases one can rely on `A`'s indices and [`checkindex`](@ref).

See also [`checkindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = rand(3, 3);

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 2)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 3, 4)
false

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3, 2:4)
false
```

```
checkbounds(A, I...)
```

Throw an error if the specified indices `I` are not in bounds for the given array `A`.
```
checkindex(Bool, inds::AbstractUnitRange, index)
```

Return `true` if the given `index` is within the bounds of `inds`. Custom types that would like to behave as indices for all arrays can extend this method in order to provide a specialized bounds checking implementation.

See also [`checkbounds`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 8)
true

julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 21)
false
```
```
chmod(path::AbstractString, mode::Integer; recursive::Bool=false)
```

Change the permissions mode of `path` to `mode`. Only integer `mode`s (e.g. `0o777`) are currently supported. If `recursive=true` and the path is a directory all permissions in that directory will be recursively changed. Return `path`.

!!! note
    Prior to Julia 1.6, this did not correctly manipulate filesystem ACLs  on Windows, therefore it would only set read-only bits on files.  It  now is able to manipulate ACLs.

```
chomp(s::AbstractString) -> SubString
```

Remove a single trailing newline from a string.

See also [`chop`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chomp("Hello\n")
"Hello"
```
```
chop(s::AbstractString; head::Integer = 0, tail::Integer = 1)
```

Remove the first `head` and the last `tail` characters from `s`. The call `chop(s)` removes the last character from `s`. If it is requested to remove more characters than `length(s)` then an empty string is returned.

See also [`chomp`](@ref), [`startswith`](@ref), [`first`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "March"
"March"

julia> chop(a)
"Marc"

julia> chop(a, head = 1, tail = 2)
"ar"

julia> chop(a, head = 5, tail = 5)
""
```
```
chopprefix(s::AbstractString, prefix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the prefix `prefix` from `s`. If `s` does not start with `prefix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopsuffix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "Ham")
"burger"

julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chopsuffix(s::AbstractString, suffix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the suffix `suffix` from `s`. If `s` does not end with `suffix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopprefix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "er")
"Hamburg"

julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chown(path::AbstractString, owner::Integer, group::Integer=-1)
```

Change the owner and/or group of `path` to `owner` and/or `group`. If the value entered for `owner` or `group` is `-1` the corresponding ID will not change. Only integer `owner`s and `group`s are currently supported. Return `path`.
```
circcopy!(dest, src)
```

Copy `src` to `dest`, indexing each dimension modulo its length. `src` and `dest` must have the same size, but can be offset in their indices; any offset results in a (circular) wraparound. If the arrays have overlapping indices, then on the domain of the overlap `dest` agrees with `src`.

See also: [`circshift`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> src = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> dest = OffsetArray{Int}(undef, (0:3,2:5))

julia> circcopy!(dest, src)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices 0:3×2:5:
 8  12  16  4
 5   9  13  1
 6  10  14  2
 7  11  15  3

julia> dest[1:3,2:4] == src[1:3,2:4]
true
```
```
circshift(A, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in an array. The second argument is a tuple or vector giving the amount to shift in each dimension, or an integer to shift only in the first dimension.

See also: [`circshift!`](@ref), [`circcopy!`](@ref), [`bitrotate`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

```
```
circshift!(dest, src, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in `src`, storing the result in `dest`. `shifts` specifies the amount to shift in each dimension.

The `dest` array must be distinct from the `src` array (they cannot alias each other).

See also [`circshift`](@ref).
```
cis(x)
```

More efficient method for `exp(im*x)` by using Euler's formula: $cos(x) + i sin(x) = \exp(i x)$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cis(π) ≈ -1

```

```
cis(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

More efficient method for `exp(im*A)` of square matrix `A` (especially if `A` is `Hermitian` or real-`Symmetric`).

See also [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincos`](@ref), [`exp`](@ref).

```
```
cispi(x)
```

More accurate method for `cis(pi*x)` (especially for large `x`).

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
clamp(x, lo, hi)
```

Return `x` if `lo <= x <= hi`. If `x > hi`, return `hi`. If `x < lo`, return `lo`. Arguments are promoted to a common type.

See also [`clamp!`](@ref), [`min`](@ref), [`max`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    `missing` as the first argument requires at least Julia 1.3.

Clamp `x` to lie within range `r`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.

```
clamp!(array::AbstractArray, lo, hi)
```

Restrict values in `array` to the specified range, in-place. See also [`clamp`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    `missing` entries in `array` require at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> row = collect(-4:4)';

julia> clamp!(row, 0, Inf)
1×9 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 0  0  0  0  0  1  2  3  4

julia> clamp.((-4:4)', 0, Inf)
1×9 Matrix{Float64}:

```
```
cld(x, y)
```

Smallest integer larger than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundUp)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`fld`](@ref).

# Examples

 -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1  2  2
```
```
close(stream)
```

Close an I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first.

```
close(c::Channel[, excp::Exception])
```

Close a channel. An exception (optionally given by `excp`), is thrown by:

  * [`put!`](@ref) on a closed channel.
  * [`take!`](@ref) and [`fetch`](@ref) on an empty, closed channel.
```
closewrite(stream)
```

Shutdown the write half of a full-duplex I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first. Notify the other end that no more data will be written to the underlying file. This is not supported by all IO types.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = Base.BufferStream(); # this never blocks, so we can read and write on the same Task

julia> write(io, "request");

julia> # calling `read(io)` here would block forever

julia> closewrite(io);

julia> read(io, String)
"request"
```
```
cmp(x,y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. Uses the total order implemented by `isless`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp(1, 2)
-1

julia> cmp(2, 1)
1

julia> cmp(2+im, 3-im)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching isless(::Complex{Int64}, ::Complex{Int64})
[...]
```

```
cmp(<, x, y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. The first argument specifies a less-than comparison function to use.

```
cmp(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Compare two strings. Return `0` if both strings have the same length and the character at each index is the same in both strings. Return `-1` if `a` is a prefix of `b`, or if `a` comes before `b` in alphabetical order. Return `1` if `b` is a prefix of `a`, or if `b` comes before `a` in alphabetical order (technically, lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp("abc", "abc")
0

julia> cmp("ab", "abc")
-1

julia> cmp("abc", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("ab", "ac")
-1

julia> cmp("ac", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("α", "a")
1

julia> cmp("b", "β")
-1
```
```
coalesce(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`missing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise return `missing`.

See also [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref), [`@coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> coalesce(missing, 1)
1

julia> coalesce(1, missing)
1

julia> coalesce(nothing, 1)  # returns `nothing`

julia> coalesce(missing, missing)
missing
```
```
code_lowered(f, types; generated=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Return an array of the lowered forms (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

If `generated` is `false`, the returned `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to fallback implementations. An error is thrown if no fallback implementation exists. If `generated` is `true`, these `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to the method bodies yielded by expanding the generators.

The keyword `debuginfo` controls the amount of code metadata present in the output.

Note that an error will be thrown if `types` are not leaf types when `generated` is `true` and any of the corresponding methods are an `@generated` method.
```
code_typed(f, types; kw...)
```

Returns an array of type-inferred lowered form (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

# Keyword Arguments

  * `optimize=true`: controls whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied.
  * `debuginfo=:default`: controls the amount of code metadata present in the output,

possible options are `:source` or `:none`.

# Internal Keyword Arguments

This section should be considered internal, and is only for who understands Julia compiler internals.

  * `world=Base.get_world_counter()`: optional, controls the world age to use when looking up methods,

use current world age if not specified.

  * `interp=Core.Compiler.NativeInterpreter(world)`: optional, controls the interpreter to use,

use the native interpreter Julia uses if not specified.

# Example

One can put the argument types in a tuple to get the corresponding `code_typed`.

```julia
julia> code_typed(+, (Float64, Float64))
1-element Vector{Any}:
 CodeInfo(
1 ─ %1 = Base.add_float(x, y)::Float64
└──      return %1
) => Float64
```
```
codepoint(c::AbstractChar) -> Integer
```

Return the Unicode codepoint (an unsigned integer) corresponding to the character `c` (or throw an exception if `c` does not represent a valid character). For `Char`, this is a `UInt32` value, but `AbstractChar` types that represent only a subset of Unicode may return a different-sized integer (e.g. `UInt8`).
```
codeunit(s::AbstractString) -> Type{<:Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}}
```

Return the code unit type of the given string object. For ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8 encoded strings, this would be `UInt8`; for UCS-2 and UTF-16 it would be `UInt16`; for UTF-32 it would be `UInt32`. The code unit type need not be limited to these three types, but it's hard to think of widely used string encodings that don't use one of these units. `codeunit(s)` is the same as `typeof(codeunit(s,1))` when `s` is a non-empty string.

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref).

```
codeunit(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}
```

Return the code unit value in the string `s` at index `i`. Note that

```
codeunit(s, i) :: codeunit(s)
```

I.e. the value returned by `codeunit(s, i)` is of the type returned by `codeunit(s)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = codeunit("Hello", 2)
0x65

julia> typeof(a)
UInt8
```

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
codeunits(s::AbstractString)
```

Obtain a vector-like object containing the code units of a string. Returns a `CodeUnits` wrapper by default, but `codeunits` may optionally be defined for new string types if necessary.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> codeunits("Juλia")
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x4a
 0x75
 0xce
 0xbb
 0x69
 0x61
```
```
collect(element_type, collection)
```

Return an `Array` with the given element type of all items in a collection or iterable. The result has the same shape and number of dimensions as `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(Float64, 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 3.0
 5.0
```

```
collect(collection)
```

Return an `Array` of all items in a collection or iterator. For dictionaries, returns `Pair{KeyType, ValType}`. If the argument is array-like or is an iterator with the [`HasShape`](@ref IteratorSize) trait, the result will have the same shape and number of dimensions as the argument.

Used by comprehensions to turn a generator into an `Array`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(1:2:13)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
 11
 13

julia> [x^2 for x in 1:8 if isodd(x)]
4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  9
 25
 49
```
```
complex(r, [i])
```

Convert real numbers or arrays to complex. `i` defaults to zero.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(7)
7 + 0im

julia> complex([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 2 + 0im
 3 + 0im
```

```
complex(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type which can represent a value of type `T` as a complex number. Equivalent to `typeof(complex(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(Complex{Int})
Complex{Int64}

julia> complex(Int)
Complex{Int64}
```
```
conj(z)
```

Compute the complex conjugate of a complex number `z`.

See also: [`angle`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj(1 + 3im)
1 - 3im
```

```
conj(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the complex conjugate of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `conj.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 0 - 2im
 3 - 4im

julia> conj(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Complex{Int64}, 0}:
2 + 1im
```
```
conj!(A)
```

Transform an array to its complex conjugate in-place.

See also [`conj`](@ref).

julia> conj!(A);

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1-1im  2+1im
 2-2im  3-1im
```
```
contains(haystack::AbstractString, needle)
```

Return `true` if `haystack` contains `needle`. This is the same as `occursin(needle, haystack)`, but is provided for consistency with `startswith(haystack, needle)` and `endswith(haystack, needle)`.

See also [`occursin`](@ref), [`in`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", "Julia")
true

julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", 'a')
true

julia> contains("aba", r"a.a")
true

julia> contains("abba", r"a.a")
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `contains` function requires at least Julia 1.5.


```
contains(needle)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument contains `needle`, i.e. a function equivalent to `haystack -> contains(haystack, needle)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(contains)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
No documentation found.

Binding `contractuser` does not exist.
```
convert(T, x)
```

Convert `x` to a value of type `T`.

If `T` is an [`Integer`](@ref) type, an [`InexactError`](@ref) will be raised if `x` is not representable by `T`, for example if `x` is not integer-valued, or is outside the range supported by `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> convert(Int, 3.0)
3

julia> convert(Int, 3.5)
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(3.5)
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

If `T` is a [`AbstractFloat`](@ref) type, then it will return the closest value to `x` representable by `T`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1/3
0.3333333333333333

julia> convert(Float32, x)
0.33333334f0

julia> convert(BigFloat, x)
0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125
```

If `T` is a collection type and `x` a collection, the result of `convert(T, x)` may alias all or part of `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = Int[1, 2, 3];

julia> y = convert(Vector{Int}, x);

julia> y === x
true
```

See also: [`round`](@ref), [`trunc`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`reinterpret`](@ref).
```
copy(x)
```

Create a shallow copy of `x`: the outer structure is copied, but not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a new array with identically-same elements as the original.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copyto!`](@ref).

```
copy(A::Transpose)
copy(A::Adjoint)
```

Eagerly evaluate the lazy matrix transpose/adjoint. Note that the transposition is applied recursively to elements.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2im; -3im 4]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0+2im
 0-3im  4+0im

julia> T = transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im

julia> copy(T)
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im
```
```
copy!(dst, src) -> dst
```

In-place [`copy`](@ref) of `src` into `dst`, discarding any pre-existing elements in `dst`. If `dst` and `src` are of the same type, `dst == src` should hold after the call. If `dst` and `src` are multidimensional arrays, they must have equal [`axes`](@ref).

See also [`copyto!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 this method is available from the `Future` standard library as `Future.copy!`.

```
copysign(x, y) -> z
```

Return `z` which has the magnitude of `x` and the same sign as `y`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> copysign(1, -2)
-1

julia> copysign(-1, 2)
1
```
```
copyto!(dest, do, src, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from collection `src` starting at offset `so`, to array `dest` starting at offset `do`. Return `dest`.

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractArray, src) -> dest
```

Copy all elements from collection `src` to array `dest`, whose length must be greater than or equal to the length `n` of `src`. The first `n` elements of `dest` are overwritten, the other elements are left untouched.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copy`](@ref).

```
copyto!(dest, Rdest::CartesianIndices, src, Rsrc::CartesianIndices) -> dest
```

Copy the block of `src` in the range of `Rsrc` to the block of `dest` in the range of `Rdest`. The sizes of the two regions must match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(5, 5);

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> Ainds = CartesianIndices((2:3, 2:3));

julia> Binds = CartesianIndices(B);

 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
```

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractMatrix, src::UniformScaling)
```

Copies a [`UniformScaling`](@ref) onto a matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    In Julia 1.0 this method only supported a square destination matrix. Julia 1.1. added support for a rectangular matrix.

```
cos(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`cosd`], [`cospi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
cos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the cosine. Otherwise, the cosine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cos(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
cosc(x)
```

Compute $\cos(\pi x) / x - \sin(\pi x) / (\pi x^2)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$. This is the derivative of `sinc(x)`.
```
cosd(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
cosh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic cosine of `x`.

```
cosh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

```
coth(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cotangent of `x`.

```
coth(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cotangent of square matrix `A`.
```
count([f=identity,] itr; init=0) -> Integer
```

Count the number of elements in `itr` for which the function `f` returns `true`. If `f` is omitted, count the number of `true` elements in `itr` (which should be a collection of boolean values). `init` optionally specifies the value to start counting from and therefore also determines the output type.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


See also: [`any`](@ref), [`sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count(i->(4<=i<=6), [2,3,4,5,6])
3

julia> count([true, false, true, true])
3

julia> count(>(3), 1:7, init=0x03)
0x07
```

```
count(
    pattern::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return the number of matches for `pattern` in `string`. This is equivalent to calling `length(findall(pattern, string))` but more efficient.

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a character as the pattern requires at least Julia 1.7.


```
count([f=identity,] A::AbstractArray; dims=:)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the given dimensions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `dims` keyword was added in Julia 1.5.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 0
```
```
count!([f=identity,] r, A)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, writing the result into `r` in-place.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    inplace `count!` was added in Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count!(<=(2), [1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:

julia> count!(<=(2), [1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 0
```
```
count_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_ones(7)
3

julia> count_ones(Int32(-1))
32
```
```
count_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_zeros(Int32(2 ^ 16 - 1))
16

julia> count_zeros(-1)
0
```
```
countlines(io::IO; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
```

Read `io` until the end of the stream/file and count the number of lines. To specify a file pass the filename as the first argument. EOL markers other than `'\n'` are supported by passing them as the second argument.  The last non-empty line of `io` is counted even if it does not end with the EOL, matching the length returned by [`eachline`](@ref) and [`readlines`](@ref).

To count lines of a `String`, `countlines(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> eof(io) # counting lines moves the file pointer
true

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io, eol = '.')
1
```
```
cp(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, follow_symlinks::Bool=false)
```

Copy the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`.

If `follow_symlinks=false`, and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be created as a symbolic link. If `follow_symlinks=true` and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be a copy of the file or directory `src` refers to. Return `dst`.

!!! note
    The `cp` function is different from the `cp` command. The `cp` function always operates on the assumption that `dst` is a file, while the command does different things depending on whether `dst` is a directory or a file. Using `force=true` when `dst` is a directory will result in loss of all the contents present in the `dst` directory, and `dst` will become a file that has the contents of `src` instead.

```
csc(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
csc(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosecant of a square matrix `A`.
```
cscd(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
csch(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cosecant of `x`.

```
csch(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cosecant of square matrix `A`.
```
ctime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).ctime`.
```
cumprod(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product along the dimension `dim`. See also [`cumprod!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Int8[1 2 3; 4 5 6];

julia> cumprod(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2   3

julia> cumprod(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2    6
 4  20  120
```

```
cumprod(itr)
```

Cumulative product of an iterator.

See also [`cumprod!`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref), [`cumsum`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumprod` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumprod(fill(1//2, 3))
3-element Vector{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//2
 1//4
 1//8

julia> cumprod((1, 2, 1, 3, 1))
(1, 2, 2, 6, 6)

julia> cumprod("julia")
5-element Vector{String}:
 "j"
 "ju"
 "jul"
 "juli"
 "julia"
```
```
cumprod!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).

```
cumprod!(y::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)
```

Cumulative product of a vector `x`, storing the result in `y`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).
```
cumsum(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum along the dimension `dims`. See also [`cumsum!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> cumsum(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 5  7  9

julia> cumsum(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3   6
 4  9  15
```

!!! note
    The return array's `eltype` is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size  and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size. To preserve `eltype` of arrays with small signed or unsigned integer `accumulate(+, A)` should be used.

    ```jldoctest
    julia> cumsum(Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int64}:
     100
     128

    julia> accumulate(+,Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int8}:
      100
     -128
    ```

    In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is `Int64[100, 128]`. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in `Int8[100, -128]`.


```
cumsum(itr)
```

Cumulative sum of an iterator.

See also [`accumulate`](@ref) to apply functions other than `+`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumsum` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumsum(1:3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 6

julia> cumsum((true, false, true, false, true))
(1, 1, 2, 2, 3)

julia> cumsum(fill(1, 2) for i in 1:3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]
 [3, 3]
```
```
cumsum!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumsum`](@ref).
```
current_exceptions(task::Task=current_task(); [backtrace::Bool=true])
```

Get the stack of exceptions currently being handled. For nested catch blocks there may be more than one current exception in which case the most recently thrown exception is last in the stack. The stack is returned as an `ExceptionStack` which is an AbstractVector of named tuples `(exception,backtrace)`. If `backtrace` is false, the backtrace in each pair will be set to `nothing`.

Explicitly passing `task` will return the current exception stack on an arbitrary task. This is useful for inspecting tasks which have failed due to uncaught exceptions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function went by the experimental name `catch_stack()` in Julia 1.1–1.6, and had a plain Vector-of-tuples as a return type.

```
current_task()
```

Get the currently running [`Task`](@ref).
```
deepcopy(x)
```

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::IdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
```
deg2rad(x)
```

Convert `x` from degrees to radians.

See also: [`rad2deg`](@ref), [`sind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deg2rad(90)
1.5707963267948966
```
```
delete!(collection, key)
```

Delete the mapping for the given key in a collection, if any, and return the collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b")
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b") # d is left unchanged
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1
```
```
deleteat!(a::Vector, i::Integer)
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

See also: [`delete!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 2)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
deleteat!(a::Vector, inds)
```

Remove the items at the indices given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

`inds` can be either an iterator or a collection of sorted and unique integer indices, or a boolean vector of the same length as `a` with `true` indicating entries to delete.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5

Denominator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> denominator(2//3)
3

julia> denominator(4)
1
```
```
detach(command)
```

Mark a command object so that it will be run in a new process group, allowing it to outlive the julia process, and not have Ctrl-C interrupts passed to it.
```
diff(A::AbstractVector)
diff(A::AbstractArray; dims::Integer)
```

Finite difference operator on a vector or a multidimensional array `A`. In the latter case the dimension to operate on needs to be specified with the `dims` keyword argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `diff` for arrays with dimension higher than 2 requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [2 4; 6 16]

```
digits([T<:Integer], n::Integer; base::T = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Return an array with element type `T` (default `Int`) of the digits of `n` in the given base, optionally padded with zeros to a specified size. More significant digits are at higher indices, such that `n == sum(digits[k]*base^(k-1) for k=1:length(digits))`.

See also [`ndigits`](@ref), [`digits!`](@ref), and for base 2 also [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> n == evalpoly(13, digits(n, base = 13))
true
```
```
digits!(array, n::Integer; base::Integer = 10)
```

Fills an array of the digits of `n` in the given base. More significant digits are at higher indices. If the array length is insufficient, the least significant digits are filled up to the array length. If the array length is excessive, the excess portion is filled with zeros.

# Examples

```
dirname(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the directory part of a path. Trailing characters ('/' or '\') in the path are counted as part of the path.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dirname("/home/myuser")
"/home"

julia> dirname("/home/myuser/")
"/home/myuser"
```

See also [`basename`](@ref).
```
disable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Disable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function on the current task, for calling external code that may call julia code that is not interrupt safe. Intended to be called using `do` block syntax as follows:

```
disable_sigint() do
    # interrupt-unsafe code
    ...
end
```

This is not needed on worker threads (`Threads.threadid() != 1`) since the `InterruptException` will only be delivered to the master thread. External functions that do not call julia code or julia runtime automatically disable sigint during their execution.
```
diskstat(path=pwd())
```

Returns statistics in bytes about the disk that contains the file or directory pointed at by `path`. If no argument is passed, statistics about the disk that contains the current working directory are returned.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
display(x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
display(mime, x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

Display `x` using the topmost applicable display in the display stack, typically using the richest supported multimedia output for `x`, with plain-text [`stdout`](@ref) output as a fallback. The `display(d, x)` variant attempts to display `x` on the given display `d` only, throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if `d` cannot display objects of this type.

In general, you cannot assume that `display` output goes to `stdout` (unlike [`print(x)`](@ref) or [`show(x)`](@ref)).  For example, `display(x)` may open up a separate window with an image. `display(x)` means "show `x` in the best way you can for the current output device(s)." If you want REPL-like text output that is guaranteed to go to `stdout`, use [`show(stdout, "text/plain", x)`](@ref) instead.

There are also two variants with a `mime` argument (a MIME type string, such as `"image/png"`), which attempt to display `x` using the requested MIME type *only*, throwing a `MethodError` if this type is not supported by either the display(s) or by `x`. With these variants, one can also supply the "raw" data in the requested MIME type by passing `x::AbstractString` (for MIME types with text-based storage, such as text/html or application/postscript) or `x::Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types).

To customize how instances of a type are displayed, overload [`show`](@ref) rather than `display`, as explained in the manual section on [custom pretty-printing](@ref man-custom-pretty-printing).
```
displayable(mime) -> Bool
displayable(d::AbstractDisplay, mime) -> Bool
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given `mime` type (string) is displayable by any of the displays in the current display stack, or specifically by the display `d` in the second variant.
```
displaysize([io::IO]) -> (lines, columns)
```

Return the nominal size of the screen that may be used for rendering output to this `IO` object. If no input is provided, the environment variables `LINES` and `COLUMNS` are read. If those are not set, a default size of `(24, 80)` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> withenv("LINES" => 30, "COLUMNS" => 100) do
           displaysize()
       end
(30, 100)
```

To get your TTY size,

```julia-repl
julia> displaysize(stdout)
(34, 147)
```
```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

# Examples:

```
```
divrem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient and remainder from Euclidean division. Equivalent to `(div(x,y,r), rem(x,y,r))`. Equivalently, with the default value of `r`, this call is equivalent to `(x÷y, x%y)`.

See also: [`fldmod`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref).

```
```
download(url::AbstractString, [path::AbstractString = tempname()]) -> path
```

Download a file from the given url, saving it to the location `path`, or if not specified, a temporary path. Returns the path of the downloaded file.

!!! note
    Since Julia 1.6, this function is deprecated and is just a thin wrapper around `Downloads.download`. In new code, you should use that function directly instead of calling this.

```
dropdims(A; dims)
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with the dimensions specified by `dims` removed. `size(A,d)` must equal 1 for every `d` in `dims`, and repeated dimensions or numbers outside `1:ndims(A)` are forbidden.

The result shares the same underlying data as `A`, such that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

See also: [`reshape`](@ref), [`vec`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

dump(x; maxdepth=8)
```

Show every part of the representation of a value. The depth of the output is truncated at `maxdepth`.

```
eachcol(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the second dimension of matrix `A`, returning the columns as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref) and [`eachslice`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> first(eachcol(a))
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> collect(eachcol(a))
2-element Vector{SubArray{Int64, 1, Matrix{Int64}, Tuple{Base.Slice{Base.OneTo{Int64}}, Int64}, true}}:
 [1, 3]
 [2, 4]
```
```
eachindex(A...)
```

Create an iterable object for visiting each index of an `AbstractArray` `A` in an efficient manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, return a specialized Cartesian range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, return an iterator object supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

If you supply more than one `AbstractArray` argument, `eachindex` will create an iterable object that is fast for all arguments (a [`UnitRange`](@ref) if all inputs have fast linear indexing, a [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) otherwise). If the arrays have different sizes and/or dimensionalities, a `DimensionMismatch` exception will be thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> for i in eachindex(A) # linear indexing
           println(i)
       end

julia> for i in eachindex(view(A, 1:2, 1:1)) # Cartesian indexing
           println(i)
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1)
CartesianIndex(2, 1)
```
```
eachline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
eachline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Create an iterable `EachLine` object that will yield each line from an I/O stream or a file. Iteration calls [`readline`](@ref) on the stream argument repeatedly with `keep` passed through, determining whether trailing end-of-line characters are retained. When called with a file name, the file is opened once at the beginning of iteration and closed at the end. If iteration is interrupted, the file will be closed when the `EachLine` object is garbage collected.

To iterate over each line of a `String`, `eachline(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

[`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) can be used on an `EachLine` object to read the lines in reverse order (for files, buffers, and other I/O streams supporting [`seek`](@ref)), and [`first`](@ref) or [`last`](@ref) can be used to extract the initial or final lines, respectively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> for line in eachline("my_file.txt")
           print(line)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members.

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Julia 1.8 is required to use `Iterators.reverse` or `last` with `eachline` iterators.

```
eachmatch(r::Regex, s::AbstractString; overlap::Bool=false)
```

Search for all matches of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return an iterator over the matches. If `overlap` is `true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from distinct character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a.a"
r"a.a"

julia> m = eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a")
Base.RegexMatchIterator(r"a.a", "a1a2a3a", false)

julia> collect(m)
2-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")

julia> collect(eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a", overlap = true))
3-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a2a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")
```
```
eachrow(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the first dimension of vector or matrix `A`, returning the rows as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
```
```
eachslice(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Create a generator that iterates over dimensions `dims` of `A`, returning views that select all the data from the other dimensions in `A`.

Only a single dimension in `dims` is currently supported. Equivalent to `(view(A,:,:,...,i,:,: ...)) for i in axes(A, dims))`, where `i` is in position `dims`.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref), [`eachcol`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), and [`selectdim`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```
```
eachsplit(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
eachsplit(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm` and return an iterator over the substrings.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`split`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `eachsplit` function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> collect(eachsplit(a, "."))
2-element Vector{SubString}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
eltype(type)
```

Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating a collection of the given `type`. For dictionary types, this will be a `Pair{KeyType,ValType}`. The definition `eltype(x) = eltype(typeof(x))` is provided for convenience so that instances can be passed instead of types. However the form that accepts a type argument should be defined for new types.

See also: [`keytype`](@ref), [`typeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eltype(fill(1f0, (2,2)))
Float32

julia> eltype(fill(0x1, (2,2)))
UInt8
```
```
empty(x::Tuple)
```

Returns an empty tuple, `()`.

```
empty(v::AbstractVector, [eltype])
```

Create an empty vector similar to `v`, optionally changing the `eltype`.

See also: [`empty!`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
Float64[]

julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], String)
String[]
```

```
empty(a::AbstractDict, [index_type=keytype(a)], [value_type=valtype(a)])
```

Create an empty `AbstractDict` container which can accept indices of type `index_type` and values of type `value_type`. The second and third arguments are optional and default to the input's `keytype` and `valtype`, respectively. (If only one of the two types is specified, it is assumed to be the `value_type`, and the `index_type` we default to `keytype(a)`).

Custom `AbstractDict` subtypes may choose which specific dictionary type is best suited to return for the given index and value types, by specializing on the three-argument signature. The default is to return an empty `Dict`.
```
empty!(collection) -> collection
```

Remove all elements from a `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> empty!(A);

julia> A
Dict{String, Int64}()
```
```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with `suffix`. If `suffix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the last character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`startswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("Sunday", "day")
true
```

```
endswith(suffix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument ends with `suffix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> endswith(y, suffix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(endswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `endswith(suffix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith_julia = endswith("Julia");

julia> endswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> endswith_julia("JuliaLang")
false
```

```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with the regex pattern, `suffix`.

!!! note
    `endswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"...$", s)` is faster than `endswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`startswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("JuliaLang", r"Lang|Roberts")
true
```
```
enumerate(iter)
```

An iterator that yields `(i, x)` where `i` is a counter starting at 1, and `x` is the `i`th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values `x` over which you are iterating, but also the number of iterations so far. Note that `i` may not be valid for indexing `iter`; it's also possible that `x != iter[i]`, if `iter` has indices that do not start at 1. See the `pairs(IndexLinear(), iter)` method if you want to ensure that `i` is an index.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
```
```
eof(stream) -> Bool
```

Test whether an I/O stream is at end-of-file. If the stream is not yet exhausted, this function will block to wait for more data if necessary, and then return `false`. Therefore it is always safe to read one byte after seeing `eof` return `false`. `eof` will return `false` as long as buffered data is still available, even if the remote end of a connection is closed.
```
eps(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractFloat
eps()
```

Return the *machine epsilon* of the floating point type `T` (`T = Float64` by default). This is defined as the gap between 1 and the next largest value representable by `typeof(one(T))`, and is equivalent to `eps(one(T))`.  (Since `eps(T)` is a bound on the *relative error* of `T`, it is a "dimensionless" quantity like [`one`](@ref).)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps()
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(Float32)
1.1920929f-7

julia> 1.0 + eps()
1.0000000000000002

julia> 1.0 + eps()/2
1.0
```

```
eps(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the *unit in last place* (ulp) of `x`. This is the distance between consecutive representable floating point values at `x`. In most cases, if the distance on either side of `x` is different, then the larger of the two is taken, that is

```
eps(x) == max(x-prevfloat(x), nextfloat(x)-x)
```

The exceptions to this rule are the smallest and largest finite values (e.g. `nextfloat(-Inf)` and `prevfloat(Inf)` for [`Float64`](@ref)), which round to the smaller of the values.

The rationale for this behavior is that `eps` bounds the floating point rounding error. Under the default `RoundNearest` rounding mode, if $y$ is a real number and $x$ is the nearest floating point number to $y$, then

$$
|y-x| \leq \operatorname{eps}(x)/2.
$$

See also: [`nextfloat`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref), [`floatmax`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(1.0)
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(prevfloat(2.0))
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(2.0)
4.440892098500626e-16

julia> x = prevfloat(Inf)      # largest finite Float64
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> x + eps(x)/2            # rounds up
Inf

julia> x + prevfloat(eps(x)/2) # rounds down
1.7976931348623157e308
```

```
eps(::Type{DateTime}) -> Millisecond
eps(::Type{Date}) -> Day
eps(::Type{Time}) -> Nanosecond
eps(::TimeType) -> Period
```

Return the smallest unit value supported by the `TimeType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(DateTime)
1 millisecond

julia> eps(Date)
1 day

julia> eps(Time)
1 nanosecond
```
```
error(message::AbstractString)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.

```
error(msg...)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.
```
errormonitor(t::Task)
```

Print an error log to `stderr` if task `t` fails.
```
esc(e)
```

Only valid in the context of an [`Expr`](@ref) returned from a macro. Prevents the macro hygiene pass from turning embedded variables into gensym variables. See the [Macros](@ref man-macros) section of the Metaprogramming chapter of the manual for more details and examples.
```
escape_string(str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::AbstractString
escape_string(io, str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::Nothing
```

General escaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`.

Backslashes (`\`) are escaped with a double-backslash (`"\\"`). Non-printable characters are escaped either with their standard C escape codes, `"\0"` for NUL (if unambiguous), unicode code point (`"\u"` prefix) or hex (`"\x"` prefix).

The optional `esc` argument specifies any additional characters that should also be escaped by a prepending backslash (`"` is also escaped by default in the first form).

The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which are to be kept as they are. Notice that `esc` has precedence here.

See also [`unescape_string`](@ref) for the reverse operation.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The `keep` argument is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb")
"aaa\\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb"; keep = '\n')
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("\xfe\xff") # invalid utf-8
"\\xfe\\xff"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0')) # unambiguous
"ℵ\\0"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0','0')) # \0 would be ambiguous
"ℵ\\x000"
```
```
evalfile(path::AbstractString, args::Vector{String}=String[])
```

Load the file using [`include`](@ref), evaluate all expressions, and return the value of the last one.
```
evalpoly(x, p)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k x^{k-1} p[k]$ for the coefficients `p[1]`, `p[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `x`. Loops are unrolled at compile time if the number of coefficients is statically known, i.e. when `p` is a `Tuple`. This function generates efficient code using Horner's method if `x` is real, or using a Goertzel-like [^DK62] algorithm if `x` is complex.

```

Compute the matrix exponential of `A`, defined by

$$
e^A = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^n}{n!}.
$$

For symmetric or Hermitian `A`, an eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, otherwise the scaling and squaring algorithm (see [^H05]) is chosen.

```

On Unix systems, replace a tilde character at the start of a path with the current user's home directory.

expm1(x)
```

Accurately compute $e^x-1$. It avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small values of x.

extrema(itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` element in a single pass, and return them as a 2-tuple.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). As a consequence, when `itr` is empty the returned `(mn, mx)` tuple will satisfy `mn ≥ mx`. When `init` is specified it may be used even for non-empty `itr`.

julia> extrema([]; init = (Inf, -Inf))
(Inf, -Inf)
```

```
extrema(f, itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` of `f` applied to each element in `itr` and return them as a 2-tuple. Only one pass is made over `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). It is used for non-empty collections. Note: it implies that, for empty `itr`, the returned value `(mn, mx)` satisfies `mn ≥ mx` even though for non-empty `itr` it  satisfies `mn ≤ mx`.  This is a "paradoxical" but yet expected result.

Return the file descriptor backing the stream or file. Note that this function only applies to synchronous `File`'s and `IOStream`'s not to any of the asynchronous streams.
```
fdio([name::AbstractString, ]fd::Integer[, own::Bool=false]) -> IOStream
```

Create an [`IOStream`](@ref) object from an integer file descriptor. If `own` is `true`, closing this object will close the underlying descriptor. By default, an `IOStream` is closed when it is garbage collected. `name` allows you to associate the descriptor with a named file.
```
fetch(c::Channel)
```

Wait for and get the first available item from the channel. Does not remove the item. `fetch` is unsupported on an unbuffered (0-size) channel.

```
fetch(t::Task)
```

Wait for a Task to finish, then return its result value. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.

```
fetch(x::Future)
```

Wait for and get the value of a [`Future`](@ref). The fetched value is cached locally. Further calls to `fetch` on the same reference return the cached value. If the remote value is an exception, throws a [`RemoteException`](@ref) which captures the remote exception and backtrace.

```
fetch(c::RemoteChannel)
```

Wait for and get a value from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). Exceptions raised are the same as for a [`Future`](@ref). Does not remove the item fetched.
```
fieldcount(t::Type)
```

Get the number of fields that an instance of the given type would have. An error is thrown if the type is too abstract to determine this.
```
fieldname(x::DataType, i::Integer)
```

Get the name of field `i` of a `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fieldname(Rational, 1)
:num

julia> fieldname(Rational, 2)
:den
```
```
fieldnames(x::DataType)
```

Get a tuple with the names of the fields of a `DataType`.

See also [`propertynames`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fieldnames(Rational)
(:num, :den)

julia> fieldnames(typeof(1+im))
(:re, :im)
```
```
fieldoffset(type, i)
```

The byte offset of field `i` of a type relative to the data start. For example, we could use it in the following manner to summarize information about a struct:

```jldoctest
julia> structinfo(T) = [(fieldoffset(T,i), fieldname(T,i), fieldtype(T,i)) for i = 1:fieldcount(T)];

julia> structinfo(Base.Filesystem.StatStruct)

```
```
fieldtypes(T::Type)
```

The declared types of all fields in a composite DataType `T` as a tuple.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> fieldtypes(Foo)
(Int64, String)
```
```
filemode(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mode`.
```
filesize(path...)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).size`.
```
fill(value, dims::Tuple)
fill(value, dims...)
```

Create an array of size `dims` with every location set to `value`.

For example, `fill(1.0, (5,5))` returns a 5×5 array of floats, with `1.0` in every location of the array.

The dimension lengths `dims` may be specified as either a tuple or a sequence of arguments. An `N`-length tuple or `N` arguments following the `value` specify an `N`-dimensional array. Thus, a common idiom for creating a zero-dimensional array with its only location set to `x` is `fill(x)`.

Every location of the returned array is set to (and is thus [`===`](@ref) to) the `value` that was passed; this means that if the `value` is itself modified, all elements of the `fill`ed array will reflect that modification because they're *still* that very `value`. This is of no concern with `fill(1.0, (5,5))` as the `value` `1.0` is immutable and cannot itself be modified, but can be unexpected with mutable values like — most commonly — arrays.  For example, `fill([], 3)` places *the very same* empty array in all three locations of the returned vector:

```jldoctest
julia> v = fill([], 3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v[1] === v[2] === v[3]
true

julia> value = v[1]
Any[]

julia> push!(value, 867_5309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
```

To create an array of many independent inner arrays, use a [comprehension](@ref man-comprehensions) instead. This creates a new and distinct array on each iteration of the loop:

```jldoctest
julia> v2 = [[] for _ in 1:3]
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v2[1] === v2[2] === v2[3]
false

julia> push!(v2[1], 8675309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v2
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 []
 []
```

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fill(1.0, (2,3))
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia> fill(42)
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
42

julia> A = fill(zeros(2), 2) # sets both elements to the same [0.0, 0.0] vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [0.0, 0.0]
 [0.0, 0.0]

julia> A[1][1] = 42; # modifies the filled value to be [42.0, 0.0]

julia> A # both A[1] and A[2] are the very same vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [42.0, 0.0]
 [42.0, 0.0]
```
```
fill!(A, x)
```

Fill array `A` with the value `x`. If `x` is an object reference, all elements will refer to the same object. `fill!(A, Foo())` will return `A` filled with the result of evaluating `Foo()` once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,3)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia> fill!(A, 2.)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0

julia> a = [1, 1, 1]; A = fill!(Vector{Vector{Int}}(undef, 3), a); a[1] = 2; A
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [2, 1, 1]
 [2, 1, 1]

3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 1
```
```
filter(f, a)
```

Return a copy of collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Support for `a` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.4.


See also: [`filter!`](@ref), [`Iterators.filter`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:10
1:10

julia> filter(isodd, a)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Return a copy of `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b")
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  2 => "b"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 1 entry:
  1 => "a"
```

```
filter(f, itr::SkipMissing{<:AbstractArray})
```

Return a vector similar to the array wrapped by the given `SkipMissing` iterator but with all missing elements and those for which `f` returns `false` removed.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1 2; missing 4]
2×2 Matrix{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1         2
  missing  4

julia> filter(isodd, skipmissing(x))
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```
```
filter!(f, a)
```

Update collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> filter!(isodd, Vector(1:10))
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter!(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Update `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b", 3=>"c")
Dict{Int64, String} with 3 entries:
  2 => "b"
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter!(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"
```
```
finalize(x)
```

Immediately run finalizers registered for object `x`.
```
finalizer(f, x)
```

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to `x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the behavior of this function is unpredictable.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`. Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or `ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

# Examples

```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing $x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

# Example

```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing $t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```
```
findall(f::Function, A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the indices or keys of `A` where `f(A[I])` returns `true`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1, 3, 4]

  :C => 0

julia> findall(x -> x >= 0, d)
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :A
 :C

```

```
findall(A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the `true` indices or keys of `A`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
findall(
    pattern::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return a `Vector{UnitRange{Int}}` of all the matches for `pattern` in `string`. Each element of the returned vector is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, like the return value of [`findnext`](@ref).

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> findall("a", "apple")
1-element Vector{UnitRange{Int64}}:
 1:1

julia> findall("nana", "banana")

 5
```

```
findfirst(A)
```

Return the index or key of the first `true` value in `A`. Return `nothing` if no such value is found. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```

```
findnext(pattern::AbstractString, string::AbstractString, start::Integer)
findnext(pattern::AbstractPattern, string::String, start::Integer)
```

Find the next occurrence of `pattern` in `string` starting at position `start`. `pattern` can be either a string, or a regular expression, in which case `string` must be of type `String`.

The return value is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, such that `s[findnext(x, s, i)] == x`:

`findnext("substring", string, i)` == `start:stop` such that `string[start:stop] == "substring"` and `i <= start`, or `nothing` if unmatched.

Get the first `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

See also: [`startswith`](@ref), [`Iterators.take`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.

```
firstindex(collection) -> Integer
firstindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the first index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the first index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[begin]` and `A[1, begin]` lower to `A[firstindex(A)]` and `A[1, firstindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`first`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> firstindex([1,2,4])
1

julia> firstindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
1
```
```
fld(x, y)
```

Largest integer less than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundDown)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fld(7.3,5.5)
1.0

julia> fld.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -2  -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

Because `fld(x, y)` implements strictly correct floored rounding based on the true value of floating-point numbers, unintuitive situations can arise. For example:

```jldoctest
julia> fld(6.0,0.1)
59.0
julia> 6.0/0.1
60.0
julia> 6.0/big(0.1)
59.99999999999999666933092612453056361837965690217069245739573412231113406246995
```

What is happening here is that the true value of the floating-point number written as `0.1` is slightly larger than the numerical value 1/10 while `6.0` represents the number 6 precisely. Therefore the true value of `6.0 / 0.1` is slightly less than 60. When doing division, this is rounded to precisely `60.0`, but `fld(6.0, 0.1)` always takes the floor of the true value, so the result is `59.0`.
```
fld1(x, y)
```

Flooring division, returning a value consistent with `mod1(x,y)`

See also [`mod1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> fld1(x, y)
4

julia> x == fld(x, y) * y + mod(x, y)
true

julia> x == (fld1(x, y) - 1) * y + mod1(x, y)
true
```
```
fldmod(x, y)
```

The floored quotient and modulus after division. A convenience wrapper for `divrem(x, y, RoundDown)`. Equivalent to `(fld(x,y), mod(x,y))`.

See also: [`fld`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).
```
fldmod1(x, y)
```

Return `(fld1(x,y), mod1(x,y))`.

See also [`fld1`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref).
```
flipsign(x, y)
```

Return `x` with its sign flipped if `y` is negative. For example `abs(x) = flipsign(x,x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> flipsign(5, 3)
5

julia> flipsign(5, -3)
-5
```
```
float(x)
```

Convert a number or array to a floating point data type.

See also: [`complex`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`convert`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(1:1000)
1.0:1.0:1000.0

julia> float(typemax(Int32))
2.147483647e9
```

```
float(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type to represent a value of type `T` as a floating point value. Equivalent to `typeof(float(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(Complex{Int})
ComplexF64 (alias for Complex{Float64})

julia> float(Int)
Float64
```
```
floatmax(T = Float64)
```

Return the largest finite number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

See also: [`typemax`](@ref), [`floatmin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmax(Float16)
Float16(6.55e4)

julia> floatmax(Float32)
3.4028235f38

julia> floatmax()
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf
```
```
floatmin(T = Float64)
```

Return the smallest positive normal number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmin(Float16)
Float16(6.104e-5)

julia> floatmin(Float32)
1.1754944f-38

julia> floatmin()
2.2250738585072014e-308
```
```
floor([T,] x)
floor(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
floor(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`floor(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is less than or equal to `x`.

`floor(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
floor(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` down to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> floor(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
30 minutes

julia> floor(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
1 day
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.

```
floor(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` less than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> floor(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> floor(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-06T00:00:00
```
```
flush(stream)
```

Commit all currently buffered writes to the given stream.
```
fma(x, y, z)
```

Computes `x*y+z` without rounding the intermediate result `x*y`. On some systems this is significantly more expensive than `x*y+z`. `fma` is used to improve accuracy in certain algorithms. See [`muladd`](@ref).
```
foldl(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

See also [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`foldr`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldl(=>, 1:4)
((1 => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> foldl(=>, 1:4; init=0)
(((0 => 1) => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> accumulate(=>, (1,2,3,4))
(1, 1 => 2, (1 => 2) => 3, ((1 => 2) => 3) => 4)
```
```
foldr(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldr(=>, 1:4)
1 => (2 => (3 => 4))

julia> foldr(=>, 1:4; init=0)
1 => (2 => (3 => (4 => 0)))
```
```
foreach(f, c...) -> Nothing
```

Call function `f` on each element of iterable `c`. For multiple iterable arguments, `f` is called elementwise, and iteration stops when any iterator is finished.

`foreach` should be used instead of [`map`](@ref) when the results of `f` are not needed, for example in `foreach(println, array)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri = 1:3:7; res = Int[];

julia> foreach(x -> push!(res, x^2), tri)

julia> res
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
 16
 49

julia> foreach((x, y) -> println(x, " with ", y), tri, 'a':'z')
1 with a
4 with b
7 with c
```
```
frexp(val)
```

Return `(x,exp)` such that `x` has a magnitude in the interval $[1/2, 1)$ or 0, and `val` is equal to $x \times 2^{exp}$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> frexp(12.8)
(0.8, 4)
```
```
fullname(m::Module)
```

Get the fully-qualified name of a module as a tuple of symbols. For example,

(:Base, :Iterators)

julia> fullname(Main)
(:Main,)
```
```
functionloc(m::Method)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a `Method` definition.

```
functionloc(f::Function, types)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a generic `Function` definition.
```
gcd(x, y...)
```

Greatest common (positive) divisor (or zero if all arguments are zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcd(6, 9)
3

julia> gcd(6, -9)
3

julia> gcd(6, 0)
6

julia> gcd(0, 0)

julia> gcd(1//3, 2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, -2//3)

julia> gcd(1//3, 2)
1//3

julia> gcd(0, 0, 10, 15)
5
```
```
gcdx(a, b)
```

Computes the greatest common (positive) divisor of `a` and `b` and their Bézout coefficients, i.e. the integer coefficients `u` and `v` that satisfy $ua+vb = d = gcd(a, b)$. $gcdx(a, b)$ returns $(d, u, v)$.

The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcdx(12, 42)
(6, -3, 1)

julia> gcdx(240, 46)
(2, -9, 47)
```

!!! note
    Bézout coefficients are *not* uniquely defined. `gcdx` returns the minimal Bézout coefficients that are computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. (Ref: D. Knuth, TAoCP, 2/e, p. 325, Algorithm X.) For signed integers, these coefficients `u` and `v` are minimal in the sense that $|u| < |y/d|$ and $|v| < |x/d|$. Furthermore, the signs of `u` and `v` are chosen so that `d` is positive. For unsigned integers, the coefficients `u` and `v` might be near their `typemax`, and the identity then holds only via the unsigned integers' modulo arithmetic.

```
gensym([tag])
```

Generates a symbol which will not conflict with other variable names.

```
getindex(type[, elements...])
```

Construct a 1-d array of the specified type. This is usually called with the syntax `Type[]`. Element values can be specified using `Type[a,b,c,...]`.

```

```
getindex(collection, key...)
```

Retrieve the value(s) stored at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...]` is converted by the compiler to `getindex(a, i, j, ...)`.

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions of the group owning the file.
```
hardlink(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString)
```

Creates a hard link to an existing source file `src` with the name `dst`. The destination, `dst`, must not exist.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
hasfield(T::Type, name::Symbol)
```

Return a boolean indicating whether `T` has `name` as one of its own fields.

See also [`fieldnames`](@ref), [`fieldcount`](@ref), [`hasproperty`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest

       end

julia> hasfield(Foo, :bar)
true

julia> hasfield(Foo, :x)

```
```
hash(x[, h::UInt]) -> UInt
```

Compute an integer hash code such that `isequal(x,y)` implies `hash(x)==hash(y)`. The optional second argument `h` is a hash code to be mixed with the result.

New types should implement the 2-argument form, typically by calling the 2-argument `hash` method recursively in order to mix hashes of the contents with each other (and with `h`). Typically, any type that implements `hash` should also implement its own [`==`](@ref) (hence [`isequal`](@ref)) to guarantee the property mentioned above. Types supporting subtraction (operator `-`) should also implement [`widen`](@ref), which is required to hash values inside heterogeneous arrays.

See also: [`objectid`](@ref), [`Dict`](@ref), [`Set`](@ref).
```
haskey(collection, key) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection has a mapping for a given `key`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> haskey(D, 'a')
true

julia> haskey(D, 'c')
false
```
```
hasmethod(f, t::Type{<:Tuple}[, kwnames]; world=get_world_counter()) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching the given `Tuple` of argument types with the upper bound of world age given by `world`.

If a tuple of keyword argument names `kwnames` is provided, this also checks whether the method of `f` matching `t` has the given keyword argument names. If the matching method accepts a variable number of keyword arguments, e.g. with `kwargs...`, any names given in `kwnames` are considered valid. Otherwise the provided names must be a subset of the method's keyword arguments.

See also [`applicable`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Providing keyword argument names requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> hasmethod(length, Tuple{Array})
true

julia> f(; oranges=0) = oranges;

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:oranges,))
true

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:apples, :bananas))
false

julia> g(; xs...) = 4;

julia> hasmethod(g, Tuple{}, (:a, :b, :c, :d))  # g accepts arbitrary kwargs
true
```
```
hasproperty(x, s::Symbol)
```

Return a boolean indicating whether the object `x` has `s` as one of its own properties.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
hcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 2. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(hcat, x)`.

```
hex2bytes(itr)
```

Given an iterable `itr` of ASCII codes for a sequence of hexadecimal digits, returns a `Vector{UInt8}` of bytes  corresponding to the binary representation: each successive pair of hexadecimal digits in `itr` gives the value of one byte in the return vector.

The length of `itr` must be even, and the returned array has half of the length of `itr`. See also [`hex2bytes!`](@ref) for an in-place version, and [`bytes2hex`](@ref) for the inverse.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `hex2bytes` with iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `hex2bytes`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> hex2bytes(s)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> a = b"01abEF"
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x30
 0x31
 0x61
 0x62
 0x45
 0x46

julia> hex2bytes(a)
3-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0xab
 0xef
```
```
hex2bytes!(dest::AbstractVector{UInt8}, itr)
```

Convert an iterable `itr` of bytes representing a hexadecimal string to its binary representation, similar to [`hex2bytes`](@ref) except that the output is written in-place to `dest`. The length of `dest` must be half the length of `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling hex2bytes! with iterators producing UInt8 requires version 1.7. In earlier versions, you can collect the iterable before calling instead.

```
homedir() -> String
```

Return the current user's home directory.

!!! note
    `homedir` determines the home directory via `libuv`'s `uv_os_homedir`. For details (for example on how to specify the home directory via environment variables), see the [`uv_os_homedir` documentation](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/misc.html#c.uv_os_homedir).

```
htol(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Little-endian.
```
hton(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Network byte order (big-endian).
```
hvcat(rows::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, values...)
```

Horizontal and vertical concatenation in one call. This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument specifies the number of arguments to concatenate in each block row.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c; d e f]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> hvcat((3,3), a,b,c,d,e,f)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> [a b; c d; e f]
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6

julia> hvcat((2,2,2), a,b,c,d,e,f)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6
```

If the first argument is a single integer `n`, then all block rows are assumed to have `n` block columns.
```
hvncat(dim::Int, row_first, values...)
hvncat(dims::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, row_first, values...)
hvncat(shape::Tuple{Vararg{Tuple}}, row_first, values...)
```

Horizontal, vertical, and n-dimensional concatenation of many `values` in one call.

This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument either specifies the shape of the concatenation, similar to `hvcat`, as a tuple of tuples, or the dimensions that specify the key number of elements along each axis, and is used to determine the output dimensions. The `dims` form is more performant, and is used by default when the concatenation operation has the same number of elements along each axis (e.g., [a b; c d;;; e f ; g h]). The `shape` form is used when the number of elements along each axis is unbalanced (e.g., [a b ; c]). Unbalanced syntax needs additional validation overhead. The `dim` form is an optimization for concatenation along just one dimension. `row_first` indicates how `values` are ordered. The meaning of the first and second elements of `shape` are also swapped based on `row_first`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c;;; d e f]

```
identity(x)
```

The identity function. Returns its argument.

See also: [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), and [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg)'s `I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> identity("Well, what did you expect?")
"Well, what did you expect?"
```
```
ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)
```

Return `x` if `condition` is `true`, otherwise return `y`. This differs from `?` or `if` in that it is an ordinary function, so all the arguments are evaluated first. In some cases, using `ifelse` instead of an `if` statement can eliminate the branch in generated code and provide higher performance in tight loops.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ifelse(1 > 2, 1, 2)
2
```
```
ignorestatus(command)
```

Mark a command object so that running it will not throw an error if the result code is non-zero.
```
imag(z)
```

Return the imaginary part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`conj`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag(1 + 3im)
3
```

```
imag(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the imaginary part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `imag.(A)`, except that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 2
 4

julia> imag(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
-1
```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

julia> 4 in a
true

julia> 5 in a
false

```
include_dependency(path::AbstractString)
```

In a module, declare that the file specified by `path` (relative or absolute) is a dependency for precompilation; that is, the module will need to be recompiled if this file changes.

This is only needed if your module depends on a file that is not used via [`include`](@ref). It has no effect outside of compilation.
```
include_string([mapexpr::Function,] m::Module, code::AbstractString, filename::AbstractString="string")
```

Like [`include`](@ref), except reads code from the given string rather than from a file.

The optional first argument `mapexpr` can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression `expr` in `code`, the `include_string` function actually evaluates `mapexpr(expr)`.  If it is omitted, `mapexpr` defaults to [`identity`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Julia 1.5 is required for passing the `mapexpr` argument.

```
indexin(a, b)
```

Return an array containing the first index in `b` for each value in `a` that is a member of `b`. The output array contains `nothing` wherever `a` is not a member of `b`.

See also: [`sortperm`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'a'];

```
```
insert!(a::Vector, index::Integer, item)
```

Insert an `item` into `a` at the given `index`. `index` is the index of `item` in the resulting `a`.

See also: [`push!`](@ref), [`replace`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

 1
 2
  "here"
 3
 4
 5

```
```
insorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given sorted collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values of the collection according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order, see [`sort`](@ref) for the keywords.

See also [`in`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> insorted(4, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # single match
true

false

julia> insorted(0, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `insorted` was added in Julia 1.6.

```
instances(T::Type)
```

Return a collection of all instances of the given type, if applicable. Mostly used for enumerated types (see `@enum`).

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> @enum Color red blue green

julia> instances(Color)
(red, blue, green)
```
```
intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    As of Julia 1.8 intersect returns a result with the eltype of the type-promoted eltypes of the two inputs


# Examples

Set{Float64} with 1 element:
  2.0
```
```
intersect!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Intersect all passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.
```
inv(x)
```

Return the multiplicative inverse of `x`, such that `x*inv(x)` or `inv(x)*x` yields [`one(x)`](@ref) (the multiplicative identity) up to roundoff errors.

If `x` is a number, this is essentially the same as `one(x)/x`, but for some types `inv(x)` may be slightly more efficient.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> inv(2)
0.5

julia> inv(1 + 2im)
0.2 - 0.4im

julia> inv(1 + 2im) * (1 + 2im)
1.0 + 0.0im

julia> inv(2//3)
3//2
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `inv(::Missing)` requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
inv(M)
```

Matrix inverse. Computes matrix `N` such that `M * N = I`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Computed by solving the left-division `N = M \ I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> M = [2 5; 1 3]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  5
 1  3

julia> N = inv(M)
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  3.0  -5.0
 -1.0   2.0

julia> M*N == N*M == Matrix(I, 2, 2)
true
```
```
invmod(n, m)
```

Take the inverse of `n` modulo `m`: `y` such that $n y = 1 \pmod m$, and $div(y,m) = 0$. This will throw an error if $m = 0$, or if $gcd(n,m) \neq 1$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> invmod(2, 5)

julia> invmod(2, 3)
2

julia> invmod(5, 6)
5
```
No documentation found.

Binding `invokelatest` does not exist.
```
invperm(v)
```

Return the inverse permutation of `v`. If `B = A[v]`, then `A == B[invperm(v)]`.

See also [`sortperm`](@ref), [`invpermute!`](@ref), [`isperm`](@ref), [`permutedims`](@ref).

# Examples

```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as an abstract type (i.e. using the `abstract` keyword).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabstracttype(AbstractArray)
true

julia> isabstracttype(Vector)
false
```
```
isapprox(x, y; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : √eps, nans::Bool=false[, norm::Function])
```

Inexact equality comparison. Two numbers compare equal if their relative distance *or* their absolute distance is within tolerance bounds: `isapprox` returns `true` if `norm(x-y) <= max(atol, rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y)))`. The default `atol` is zero and the default `rtol` depends on the types of `x` and `y`. The keyword argument `nans` determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).

For real or complex floating-point values, if an `atol > 0` is not specified, `rtol` defaults to the square root of [`eps`](@ref) of the type of `x` or `y`, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significant digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an `atol > 0` is supplied, `rtol` defaults to zero.

The `norm` keyword defaults to `abs` for numeric `(x,y)` and to `LinearAlgebra.norm` for arrays (where an alternative `norm` choice is sometimes useful). When `x` and `y` are arrays, if `norm(x-y)` is not finite (i.e. `±Inf` or `NaN`), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of `x` and `y` are approximately equal component-wise.

The binary operator `≈` is equivalent to `isapprox` with the default arguments, and `x ≉ y` is equivalent to `!isapprox(x,y)`.

Note that `x ≈ 0` (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to `x == 0` since the default `atol` is `0`.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate `atol` (or use `norm(x) ≤ atol`) or rearrange your code (e.g. use `x ≈ y` rather than `x - y ≈ 0`).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero `atol` automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the "units") of your problem: for example, in `x - y ≈ 0`, `atol=1e-9` is an absurdly small tolerance if `x` is the [radius of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius) in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if `x` is the [radius of a Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) in meters.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Passing the `norm` keyword argument when comparing numeric (non-array) arguments requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; atol=0.05)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.34)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.33)
false

julia> 0.1 + 1e-10 ≈ 0.1
true

julia> 1e-10 ≈ 0
false

julia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)
true

julia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0]) # using `norm`
true
```

```
isapprox(x; kwargs...) / ≈(x; kwargs...)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using `≈`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y ≈ x`.

The keyword arguments supported here are the same as those in the 2-argument `isapprox`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This method requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
isascii(c::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character belongs to the ASCII character set, or whether this is true for all elements of a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isascii('a')
true

julia> isascii('α')
false

julia> isascii("abc")
true

julia> isascii("αβγ")
false
```

For example, `isascii` can be used as a predicate function for [`filter`](@ref) or [`replace`](@ref) to remove or replace non-ASCII characters, respectively:

```jldoctest
julia> filter(isascii, "abcdeγfgh") # discard non-ASCII chars
"abcdefgh"

julia> replace("abcdeγfgh", !isascii=>' ') # replace non-ASCII chars with spaces
"abcde fgh"
```
```
isassigned(array, i) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given array has a value associated with index `i`. Return `false` if the index is out of bounds, or has an undefined reference.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 5)
true

julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 3 * 3 + 1)
false

julia> mutable struct Foo end

julia> v = similar(rand(3), Foo)
3-element Vector{Foo}:
 #undef
 #undef
 #undef

julia> isassigned(v, 1)
false
```

```
isassigned(ref::RefValue) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given [`Ref`](@ref) is associated with a value. This is always true for a [`Ref`](@ref) of a bitstype object. Return `false` if the reference is undefined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ref = Ref{Function}()
Base.RefValue{Function}(#undef)

julia> isassigned(ref)
false

julia> ref[] = (foobar(x) = x)
foobar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> isassigned(ref)
true

julia> isassigned(Ref{Int}())
true
```
```
isbits(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is an instance of an [`isbitstype`](@ref) type.
```
isbitstype(T)
```

Return `true` if type `T` is a "plain data" type, meaning it is immutable and contains no references to other values, only `primitive` types and other `isbitstype` types. Typical examples are numeric types such as [`UInt8`](@ref), [`Float64`](@ref), and [`Complex{Float64}`](@ref). This category of types is significant since they are valid as type parameters, may not track [`isdefined`](@ref) / [`isassigned`](@ref) status, and have a defined layout that is compatible with C.

See also [`isbits`](@ref), [`isprimitivetype`](@ref), [`ismutable`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isbitstype(Complex{Float64})
true

julia> isbitstype(Complex)
false
```
```
isblockdev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a block device, `false` otherwise.
```
ischardev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a character device, `false` otherwise.
```
iscntrl(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

julia> iscntrl('a')
false
```
```
isconcretetype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a concrete type, meaning it could have direct instances (values `x` such that `typeof(x) === T`).

See also: [`isbits`](@ref), [`isabstracttype`](@ref), [`issingletontype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isconcretetype(Complex)
false

julia> isconcretetype(Complex{Float32})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex{Float32}})

isdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is a decimal digit (0-9).

```
```
isdir(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a directory, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdir(homedir())

false
```

See also [`isfile`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isdirpath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path refers to a directory (for example, ends with a path separator).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdirpath("/home")
false

julia> isdirpath("/home/")
true
```
```
isdisjoint(a, b) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the collections `a` and `b` are disjoint. Equivalent to `isempty(a ∩ b)` but more efficient when possible.

See also: [`intersect`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdisjoint([1, 2], [2, 3, 4])
false

julia> isdisjoint([3, 1], [2, 4])
true
```
```
isdispatchtuple(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a tuple "leaf type", meaning it could appear as a type signature in dispatch and has no subtypes (or supertypes) which could appear in a call.
```
isempty(collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isempty([])
true

julia> isempty([1 2 3])
false
```

```
isempty(condition)
```

Return `true` if no tasks are waiting on the condition, `false` otherwise.
```
isequal(x, y)
```

Similar to [`==`](@ref), except for the treatment of floating point numbers and of missing values. `isequal` treats all floating-point `NaN` values as equal to each other, treats `-0.0` as unequal to `0.0`, and [`missing`](@ref) as equal to `missing`. Always returns a `Bool` value.

`isequal` is an equivalence relation - it is reflexive (`===` implies `isequal`), symmetric (`isequal(a, b)` implies `isequal(b, a)`) and transitive (`isequal(a, b)` and `isequal(b, c)` implies `isequal(a, c)`).

# Implementation

The default implementation of `isequal` calls `==`, so a type that does not involve floating-point values generally only needs to define `==`.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that types for which a custom `==` or `isequal` method exists must implement a corresponding [`hash`](@ref) method (and vice versa). Collections typically implement `isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

Furthermore, `isequal` is linked with [`isless`](@ref), and they work together to define a fixed total ordering, where exactly one of `isequal(x, y)`, `isless(x, y)`, or `isless(y, x)` must be `true` (and the other two `false`).

Scalar types generally do not need to implement `isequal` separate from `==`, unless they represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient implementation than that provided as a generic fallback (based on `isnan`, `signbit`, and `==`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isequal([1., NaN], [1., NaN])
true

julia> [1., NaN] == [1., NaN]
false

julia> 0.0 == -0.0
true

julia> isequal(0.0, -0.0)
false

julia> missing == missing
missing

julia> isequal(missing, missing)
true
```

```
isequal(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`isequal`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> isequal(y, x)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(isequal)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
```
iseven(x::Number) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `x` is an even integer (that is, an integer divisible by 2), and `false` otherwise.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Non-`Integer` arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iseven(9)
false

julia> iseven(10)
true
```
```
isfifo(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a FIFO, `false` otherwise.
```
isfile(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a regular file, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfile(homedir())
false

julia> f = open("test_file.txt", "w");

julia> isfile(f)
true

julia> close(f); rm("test_file.txt")
```

See also [`isdir`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isfinite(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is finite.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfinite(5)
true

julia> isfinite(NaN32)
false
```
```
isimmutable(v) -> Bool
```

!!! warning
    Consider using `!ismutable(v)` instead, as `isimmutable(v)` will be replaced by `!ismutable(v)` in a future release. (Since Julia 1.5)


Return `true` iff value `v` is immutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isimmutable(1)
true

julia> isimmutable([1,2])
false
```
```
isinf(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is infinite.

See also: [`Inf`](@ref), [`iszero`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).
```
isinteger(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` is numerically equal to some integer.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isinteger(4.0)
true
```
```
isinteractive() -> Bool
```

Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.
```
isless(t1::Tuple, t2::Tuple)
```

Returns true when t1 is less than t2 in lexicographic order.

```
isless(x, y)
```

Test whether `x` is less than `y`, according to a fixed total order (defined together with [`isequal`](@ref)). `isless` is not defined on all pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, if it is defined, it is expected to satisfy the following:

  * If `isless(x, y)` is defined, then so is `isless(y, x)` and `isequal(x, y)`, and exactly one of those three yields `true`.
  * The relation defined by `isless` is transitive, i.e., `isless(x, y) && isless(y, z)` implies `isless(x, z)`.

Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`, are ordered after regular values. [`missing`](@ref) values are ordered last.

This is the default comparison used by [`sort`](@ref).

# Implementation

Non-numeric types with a total order should implement this function. Numeric types only need to implement it if they have special values such as `NaN`. Types with a partial order should implement [`<`](@ref). See the documentation on [Alternate orderings](@ref) for how to define alternate ordering methods that can be used in sorting and related functions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless(1, 3)
true

julia> isless("Red", "Blue")
false
```

```
isless(A::AbstractVector, B::AbstractVector)
```

Returns true when `A` is less than `B` in lexicographic order.

```
isless(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether string `a` comes before string `b` in alphabetical order (technically, in lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless("a", "b")
true

julia> isless("β", "α")
false

julia> isless("a", "a")
false

islink(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a symbolic link, `false` otherwise.
```
islocked(lock) -> Status (Boolean)

Return `true` if `path` is a mount point, `false` otherwise.
```
ismutable(v) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if and only if value `v` is mutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

true
```
```
isopen(object) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an object - such as a stream or timer – is not yet closed. Once an object is closed, it will never produce a new event. However, since a closed stream may still have data to read in its buffer, use [`eof`](@ref) to check for the ability to read data. Use the `FileWatching` package to be notified when a stream might be writable or readable.

# Examples

julia> isopen(io)
true

julia> close(io)

julia> isopen(io)
false
```
```
ispath(path) -> Bool

isreadonly(io) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a stream is read-only.

# Examples

julia> isreadonly(io)
true

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> isreadonly(io)
false
```
```
isready(c::Channel)
```

Determine whether a [`Channel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Returns immediately, does not block.

For unbuffered channels returns `true` if there are tasks waiting on a [`put!`](@ref).

```
isready(rr::Future)
```

Determine whether a [`Future`](@ref) has a value stored to it.

If the argument `Future` is owned by a different node, this call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for `rr` in a separate task instead or to use a local [`Channel`](@ref) as a proxy:

```julia
p = 1
f = Future(p)
errormonitor(@async put!(f, remotecall_fetch(long_computation, p)))
isready(f)  # will not block
```

```
isready(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Determine whether a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Note that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may no longer be true. However, it can be safely used on a [`Future`](@ref) since they are assigned only once.
```
isreal(x) -> Bool

true

julia> issorted([(1, "b"), (2, "a")], by = x -> x[1])

```

Determine whether a task has exited.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a2() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a2);

julia> istaskdone(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
istaskfailed(t::Task) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a task has exited because an exception was thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a4() = error("task failed");

julia> b = Task(a4);

julia> istaskfailed(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskfailed(b)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
istaskstarted(t::Task) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a task has started executing.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a3() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a3);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false
```
```
istextmime(m::MIME)
```

Determine whether a MIME type is text data. MIME types are assumed to be binary data except for a set of types known to be text data (possibly Unicode).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> istextmime(MIME("text/plain"))
true

julia> istextmime(MIME("image/png"))
false
```
```
isunordered(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is a value that is not orderable according to [`<`](@ref), such as `NaN` or `missing`.

The values that evaluate to `true` with this predicate may be orderable with respect to other orderings such as [`isless`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
isuppercase(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is an uppercase letter (according to the Unicode standard's `Uppercase` derived property).

See also [`islowercase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isuppercase('γ')
false

julia> isuppercase('Γ')
true

julia> isuppercase('❤')
false
```
```
isvalid(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Bool
```

Predicate indicating whether the given index is the start of the encoding of a character in `s` or not. If `isvalid(s, i)` is true then `s[i]` will return the character whose encoding starts at that index, if it's false, then `s[i]` will raise an invalid index error or a bounds error depending on if `i` is in bounds. In order for `isvalid(s, i)` to be an O(1) function, the encoding of `s` must be [self-synchronizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code). This is a basic assumption of Julia's generic string support.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`iterate`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref), [`length`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγdef";

julia> isvalid(str, 1)
true

julia> str[1]
'α': Unicode U+03B1 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> isvalid(str, 2)
false

julia> str[2]
ERROR: StringIndexError: invalid index [2], valid nearby indices [1]=>'α', [3]=>'β'
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
isvalid(value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for its type, which currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String` or `SubString{String}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char(0xd800))
false

julia> isvalid(SubString(String(UInt8[0xfe,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80]),1,2))
false

julia> isvalid(Char(0xd799))
true
```

```
isvalid(T, value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for that type. Types currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String`. Values for `AbstractChar` can be of type `AbstractChar` or [`UInt32`](@ref). Values for `String` can be of that type, `SubString{String}`, `Vector{UInt8}`, or a contiguous subarray thereof.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd800)
false

julia> isvalid(String, SubString("thisisvalid",1,5))
true

julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd799)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Support for subarray values was added in Julia 1.6.

```
iswritable(io) -> Bool
```

Return `false` if the specified IO object is not writable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           print(io, "Hello world!");
           iswritable(io)
       end
true

julia> open("myfile.txt", "r") do io
           iswritable(io)
       end
false

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isxdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character is a valid hexadecimal digit. Note that this does not include `x` (as in the standard `0x` prefix).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isxdigit('a')
true

julia> isxdigit('x')
false
```
```
iszero(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == zero(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether all of the elements of `x` are zero.

See also: [`isone`](@ref), [`isinteger`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iszero(0.0)
true

julia> iszero([1, 9, 0])
false

julia> iszero([false, 0, 0])
true
```
```
iterate(iter [, state]) -> Union{Nothing, Tuple{Any, Any}}
```

Advance the iterator to obtain the next element. If no elements remain, `nothing` should be returned. Otherwise, a 2-tuple of the next element and the new iteration state should be returned.

```
iterate(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{Tuple{<:AbstractChar, Int}, Nothing}
```

Return a tuple of the character in `s` at index `i` with the index of the start of the following character in `s`. This is the key method that allows strings to be iterated, yielding a sequences of characters. If `i` is out of bounds in `s` then a bounds error is raised. The `iterate` function, as part of the iteration protocol may assume that `i` is the start of a character in `s`.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
join([io::IO,] iterator [, delim [, last]])
```

Join any `iterator` into a single string, inserting the given delimiter (if any) between adjacent items.  If `last` is given, it will be used instead of `delim` between the last two items.  Each item of `iterator` is converted to a string via `print(io::IOBuffer, x)`. If `io` is given, the result is written to `io` rather than returned as a `String`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> join(["apples", "bananas", "pineapples"], ", ", " and ")
"apples, bananas and pineapples"

julia> join([1,2,3,4,5])
"12345"
```
```
joinpath(parts::AbstractString...) -> String
joinpath(parts::Vector{AbstractString}) -> String
joinpath(parts::Tuple{AbstractString}) -> String
```

Join path components into a full path. If some argument is an absolute path or (on Windows) has a drive specification that doesn't match the drive computed for the join of the preceding paths, then prior components are dropped.

Note on Windows since there is a current directory for each drive, `joinpath("c:", "foo")` represents a path relative to the current directory on drive "c:" so this is equal to "c:foo", not "c:\foo". Furthermore, `joinpath` treats this as a non-absolute path and ignores the drive letter casing, hence `joinpath("C:\A","c:b") = "C:\A\b"`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath("/home/myuser", "example.jl")
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath(["/home/myuser", "example.jl"])
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```
```
keepat!(a::Vector, inds)
keepat!(a::BitVector, inds)
```

Remove the items at all the indices which are not given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Items which are kept are shifted to fill the resulting gaps.

`inds` must be an iterator of sorted and unique integer indices. See also [`deleteat!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keepat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 2
```

```
keepat!(a::Vector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
keepat!(a::BitVector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
```

The in-place version of logical indexing `a = a[m]`. That is, `keepat!(a, m)` on vectors of equal length `a` and `m` will remove all elements from `a` for which `m` at the corresponding index is `false`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [:a, :b, :c];

julia> keepat!(a, [true, false, true])
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c

julia> a
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c
```
```
keys(a::AbstractArray)
```

Return an efficient array describing all valid indices for `a` arranged in the shape of `a` itself.

They keys of 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) are integers, whereas all other N-dimensional arrays use [`CartesianIndex`](@ref) to describe their locations.  Often the special array types [`LinearIndices`](@ref) and [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) are used to efficiently represent these arrays of integers and `CartesianIndex`es, respectively.

Note that the `keys` of an array might not be the most efficient index type; for maximum performance use  [`eachindex`](@ref) instead.

```
keys(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values (e.g. arrays and dictionaries), return an iterator over the keys.

```
keys(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all keys in a dictionary. `collect(keys(a))` returns an array of keys. When the keys are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(keys(D))
2-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

```
keys(m::RegexMatch) -> Vector
```

Return a vector of keys for all capture groups of the underlying regex. A key is included even if the capture group fails to match. That is, `idx` will be in the return value even if `m[idx] == nothing`.

Unnamed capture groups will have integer keys corresponding to their index. Named capture groups will have string keys.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method was added in Julia 1.6


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keys(match(r"(?<hour>\d+):(?<minute>\d+)(am|pm)?", "11:30"))
3-element Vector{Any}:
  "hour"
  "minute"
 3
```
```
keytype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
keytype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the key type of an array. This is equal to the `eltype` of the result of `keys(...)`, and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype([1, 2, 3]) == Int
true

julia> keytype([1 2; 3 4])
CartesianIndex{2}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
keytype(type)
```

Get the key type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
Int32
```
```
kill(p::Process, signum=Base.SIGTERM)
```

Send a signal to a process. The default is to terminate the process. Returns successfully if the process has already exited, but throws an error if killing the process failed for other reasons (e.g. insufficient permissions).

```
kill(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)
```

Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, by [`rmprocs`](@ref). It should cause the remote worker specified by `pid` to exit. `kill(manager::ClusterManager.....)` executes a remote `exit()` on `pid`.
```
kron(A, B)
```

Kronecker tensor product of two vectors or two matrices.

For real vectors `v` and `w`, the Kronecker product is related to the outer product by `kron(v,w) == vec(w * transpose(v))` or `w * transpose(v) == reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))`. Note how the ordering of `v` and `w` differs on the left and right of these expressions (due to column-major storage). For complex vectors, the outer product `w * v'` also differs by conjugation of `v`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> B = [im 1; 1 -im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im
 1+0im  0-1im

julia> kron(A, B)
4×4 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im  0+2im  2+0im
 1+0im  0-1im  2+0im  0-2im
 0+3im  3+0im  0+4im  4+0im
 3+0im  0-3im  4+0im  0-4im

julia> v = [1, 2]; w = [3, 4, 5];

julia> w*transpose(v)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10

julia> reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10
```
```
kron!(C, A, B)
```

`kron!` is the in-place version of [`kron`](@ref). Computes `kron(A, B)` and stores the result in `C` overwriting the existing value of `C`.

!!! tip
    Bounds checking can be disabled by [`@inbounds`](@ref), but you need to take care of the shape of `C`, `A`, `B` yourself.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
last(coll)
```

Get the last element of an ordered collection, if it can be computed in O(1) time. This is accomplished by calling [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last index. Return the end point of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) even if it is empty.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`endswith`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(1:2:10)
9

julia> last([1; 2; 3; 4])
4
```

```
last(itr, n::Integer)
```

Get the last `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(["foo", "bar", "qux"], 2)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "bar"
 "qux"

julia> last(1:6, 10)
1:6

julia> last(Float64[], 1)
Float64[]
```

```
last(s::AbstractString, n::Integer)
```

Get a string consisting of the last `n` characters of `s`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 0)
""

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 1)
"0"

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 3)
"²>0"
```
```
lastindex(collection) -> Integer
lastindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the last index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the last index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[end]` and `A[end, end]` lower to `A[lastindex(A)]` and `A[lastindex(A, 1), lastindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`axes`](@ref), [`firstindex`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lastindex([1,2,4])
3

julia> lastindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
4
```
```
lcm(x, y...)
```

Least common (positive) multiple (or zero if any argument is zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lcm(2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(-2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(0, 3)
0

julia> lcm(0, 0)
0

julia> lcm(1//3, 2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, -2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, 2)
2//1

julia> lcm(1, 3, 5, 7)
105
```
```
ldexp(x, n)
```

Compute $x \times 2^n$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ldexp(5., 2)
20.0
```
```
leading_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_ones(UInt32(2 ^ 32 - 2))
31
```
```
leading_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_zeros(Int32(1))
31
```
```
length(collection) -> Integer
```

Return the number of elements in the collection.

Use [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last valid index of an indexable collection.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length(1:5)
5

julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the number of elements in the array, defaults to `prod(size(A))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(s::AbstractString) -> Int
length(s::AbstractString, i::Integer, j::Integer) -> Int
```

Return the number of characters in string `s` from indices `i` through `j`.

This is computed as the number of code unit indices from `i` to `j` which are valid character indices. With only a single string argument, this computes the number of characters in the entire string. With `i` and `j` arguments it computes the number of indices between `i` and `j` inclusive that are valid indices in the string `s`. In addition to in-bounds values, `i` may take the out-of-bounds value `ncodeunits(s) + 1` and `j` may take the out-of-bounds value `0`.

!!! note
    The time complexity of this operation is linear in general. That is, it will take the time proportional to the number of bytes or characters in the string because it counts the value on the fly. This is in contrast to the method for arrays, which is a constant-time operation.


See also [`isvalid`](@ref), [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length("jμΛIα")
5
```
```
lock(lock)
```

Acquire the `lock` when it becomes available. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

Each `lock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).

```
lock(f::Function, lock)
```

Acquire the `lock`, execute `f` with the `lock` held, and release the `lock` when `f` returns. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

When this function returns, the `lock` has been released, so the caller should not attempt to `unlock` it.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a [`Channel`](@ref) as the second argument requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
log(b,x)
```

Compute the base `b` logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(4,8)
1.5

julia> log(4,2)
0.5

```

!!! note
    If `b` is a power of 2 or 10, [`log2`](@ref) or [`log10`](@ref) should be used, as these will typically be faster and more accurate. For example,

    ```jldoctest

log(x)
```

Compute the natural logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments to obtain complex results.

See also [`log1p`], [`log2`], [`log10`].

# Examples

log(A::StridedMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of `A`, i.e. the unique matrix $X$ such that $e^X = A$ and $-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi$ for all the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $X$. If `A` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, if `A` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [^AH12] and [^AHR13]). If `A` is real with no negative eigenvalues, then the real Schur form is computed. Otherwise, the complex Schur form is computed. Then the upper (quasi-)triangular algorithm in [^AHR13] is used on the upper (quasi-)triangular factor.

```
```
lowercasefirst(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to lowercase.

See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercasefirst("Julia")
"julia"
```
```
lpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the left with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lpad("March", 10)
"     March"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
lstat(file)
```

Like [`stat`](@ref), but for symbolic links gets the info for the link itself rather than the file it refers to. This function must be called on a file path rather than a file object or a file descriptor.
```
lstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
lstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = lpad("March", 20)
"               March"

julia> lstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
ltoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Little-endian to that used by the Host.
```
macroexpand(m::Module, x; recursive=true)
```

Take the expression `x` and return an equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded) for executing in module `m`. The `recursive` keyword controls whether deeper levels of nested macros are also expanded. This is demonstrated in the example below:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m1()
               42
           end
           macro m2()
               :(@m1())
           end
       end
M

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=true)
42

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=false)
:(#= REPL[16]:6 =# M.@m1)
```
```
map(f, c...) -> collection
```

Transform collection `c` by applying `f` to each element. For multiple collection arguments, apply `f` elementwise, and stop when when any of them is exhausted.

See also [`map!`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`mapreduce`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`Iterators.map`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> map(x -> x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 4
 6

julia> map(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 400, 5000])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 11
 22
 33
```

```
map(f, A::AbstractArray...) -> N-array
```

When acting on multi-dimensional arrays of the same [`ndims`](@ref), they must all have the same [`axes`](@ref), and the answer will too.

See also [`broadcast`](@ref), which allows mismatched sizes.

# Examples

```
julia> map(//, [1 2; 3 4], [4 3; 2 1])
2×2 Matrix{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//4  2//3
 3//2  4//1

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], zeros(2,1))
ERROR: DimensionMismatch

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], [1,10,100,1000], zeros(3,1))  # iterates until 3rd is exhausted
3-element Vector{Float64}:
   2.0
  13.0
 102.0
```
```
map!(function, destination, collection...)
```

Like [`map`](@ref), but stores the result in `destination` rather than a new collection. `destination` must be at least as large as the smallest collection.

See also: [`map`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`copyto!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = zeros(3);

julia> map!(x -> x * 2, a, [1, 2, 3]);

julia> a
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 2.0
 4.0
 6.0

julia> map!(+, zeros(Int, 5), 100:999, 1:3)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 101
 103
 105
   0
   0
```

```
map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))
```

Modifies `dict` by transforming each value from `val` to `f(val)`. Note that the type of `dict` cannot be changed: if `f(val)` is not an instance of the value type of `dict` then it will be converted to the value type if possible and otherwise raise an error.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))` requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2)
Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries:
  :a => 1
  :b => 2

julia> map!(v -> v-1, values(d))
ValueIterator for a Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  0
  1
```
```
mapfoldl(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity, as in [`foldl`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapfoldr(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity, as in [`foldr`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapreduce(f, op, itrs...; [init])
```

Apply function `f` to each element(s) in `itrs`, and then reduce the result using the binary function `op`. If provided, `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

[`mapreduce`](@ref) is functionally equivalent to calling `reduce(op, map(f, itr); init=init)`, but will in general execute faster since no intermediate collection needs to be created. See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref) and [`map`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mapreduce(x->x^2, +, [1:3;]) # == 1 + 4 + 9
14
```

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent. Additionally, some implementations may reuse the return value of `f` for elements that appear multiple times in `itr`. Use [`mapfoldl`](@ref) or [`mapfoldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity and invocation of `f` for every value.

```
mapreduce(f, op, A::AbstractArray...; dims=:, [init])
```

Evaluates to the same as `reduce(op, map(f, A...); dims=dims, init=init)`, but is generally faster because the intermediate array is avoided.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14

julia> mapreduce(isodd, |, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  1  1  1
```
```
mapslices(f, A; dims)
```

Transform the given dimensions of array `A` using function `f`. `f` is called on each slice of `A` of the form `A[...,:,...,:,...]`. `dims` is an integer vector specifying where the colons go in this expression. The results are concatenated along the remaining dimensions. For example, if `dims` is `[1,2]` and `A` is 4-dimensional, `f` is called on `A[:,:,i,j]` for all `i` and `j`.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16),(2,2,2,2))

```
```
mark(s::IO)
```

Add a mark at the current position of stream `s`. Return the marked position.

See also [`unmark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
match(r::Regex, s::AbstractString[, idx::Integer[, addopts]])
```

Search for the first match of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return a [`RegexMatch`](@ref) object containing the match, or nothing if the match failed. The matching substring can be retrieved by accessing `m.match` and the captured sequences can be retrieved by accessing `m.captures` The optional `idx` argument specifies an index at which to start the search.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a(.)a"
r"a(.)a"

julia> m = match(rx, "cabac")
RegexMatch("aba", 1="b")

julia> m.captures
1-element Vector{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}}}:
 "b"

julia> m.match
"aba"

julia> match(rx, "cabac", 3) === nothing
true
```
```
max(x, y, ...)
```

Return the maximum of the arguments (with respect to [`isless`](@ref)). See also the [`maximum`](@ref) function to take the maximum element from a collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> max(2, 5, 1)
5
```
```
maximum(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest result of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> maximum(length, ["Julion", "Julia", "Jule"])
6

julia> maximum(length, []; init=-1)
-1

julia> maximum(sin, Real[]; init=-1.0)  # good, since output of sin is >= -1
-1.0
```

```
maximum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest element in a collection.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

```

```
maximum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`max(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the maximum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `max.(a,b)`.

See also: [`maximum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmax`](@ref), [`argmax`](@ref).

julia> maximum(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 4
```

```
maximum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

```
```
maximum!(r, A)
```

Compute the maximum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

```
```
maxintfloat(T=Float64)
```

The largest consecutive integer-valued floating-point number that is exactly represented in the given floating-point type `T` (which defaults to `Float64`).

That is, `maxintfloat` returns the smallest positive integer-valued floating-point number `n` such that `n+1` is *not* exactly representable in the type `T`.

When an `Integer`-type value is needed, use `Integer(maxintfloat(T))`.

```
maxintfloat(T, S)
```

The largest consecutive integer representable in the given floating-point type `T` that also does not exceed the maximum integer representable by the integer type `S`.  Equivalently, it is the minimum of `maxintfloat(T)` and [`typemax(S)`](@ref).
```
merge(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. If the same key is present in another collection, the value for that key will be the value it has in the last collection listed. See also [`mergewith`](@ref) for custom handling of values with the same key.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict("foo" => 0.0, "bar" => 42.0)
Dict{String, Float64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> b = Dict("baz" => 17, "bar" => 4711)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 4711
  "baz" => 17

julia> merge(a, b)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 4711.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> merge(b, a)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, bs::NamedTuple...)
```

Construct a new named tuple by merging two or more existing ones, in a left-associative manner. Merging proceeds left-to-right, between pairs of named tuples, and so the order of fields present in both the leftmost and rightmost named tuples take the same position as they are found in the leftmost named tuple. However, values are taken from matching fields in the rightmost named tuple that contains that field. Fields present in only the rightmost named tuple of a pair are appended at the end. A fallback is implemented for when only a single named tuple is supplied, with signature `merge(a::NamedTuple)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Merging 3 or more `NamedTuple` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), (b=4, d=5))
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2), (b=3, c=(d=1,)), (c=(d=2,),))
(a = 1, b = 3, c = (d = 2,))
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, iterable)
```

Interpret an iterable of key-value pairs as a named tuple, and perform a merge.

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), [:b=>4, :d=>5])
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```
```
merge!(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. See also [`merge`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> d2 = Dict(1 => 4, 4 => 5);

julia> merge!(d1, d2);

julia> d1
Dict{Int64, Int64} with 3 entries:
  4 => 5
  3 => 4
  1 => 4
```
```
mergewith(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
mergewith(combine)
merge(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `mergewith` requires Julia 1.5 or later.

true
```
```
mergewith!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
mergewith!(combine)
merge!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith!(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith!(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge!(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith!(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
methods(f, [types], [module])
```

Return the method table for `f`.

```

```
minimum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`min(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the minimum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `min.(a,b)`.

See also: [`minimum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmin`](@ref), [`argmin`](@ref).

# Examples

 3
```

```
minimum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

 1  4

julia> minimum(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:

```
```
minimum!(r, A)
```

Compute the minimum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

```
```
minmax(x, y)
```

Return `(min(x,y), max(x,y))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> minmax('c','b')
('b', 'c')
```
```
mkdir(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Make a new directory with name `path` and permissions `mode`. `mode` defaults to `0o777`, modified by the current file creation mask. This function never creates more than one directory. If the directory already exists, or some intermediate directories do not exist, this function throws an error. See [`mkpath`](@ref) for a function which creates all required intermediate directories. Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> mkdir("testingdir")
"testingdir"

julia> cd("testingdir")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/testingdir"
```
```
mkpath(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Create all intermediate directories in the `path` as required. Directories are created with the permissions `mode` which defaults to `0o777` and is modified by the current file creation mask. Unlike [`mkdir`](@ref), `mkpath` does not error if `path` (or parts of it) already exists. However, an error will be thrown if `path` (or parts of it) points to an existing file. Return `path`.

If `path` includes a filename you will probably want to use `mkpath(dirname(path))` to avoid creating a directory using the filename.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd(mktempdir())

julia> mkpath("my/test/dir") # creates three directories
"my/test/dir"

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "my"

julia> cd("my")

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "test"

julia> readdir("test")

```
```
mktemp(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> (path, io)
```

Return `(path, io)`, where `path` is the path of a new temporary file in `parent` and `io` is an open file object for this path. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary file is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktemp` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


```
mktemp(f::Function, parent=tempdir())
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktemp(parent)`](@ref) and remove the temporary file upon completion.

See also: [`mktempdir`](@ref).
```
mktempdir(parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_", cleanup=true) -> path
```

Create a temporary directory in the `parent` directory with a name constructed from the given prefix and a random suffix, and return its path. Additionally, any trailing `X` characters may be replaced with random characters. If `parent` does not exist, throw an error. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary directory is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.


!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktempdir` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.

```
mod(x::Integer, r::AbstractUnitRange)
```

Find `y` in the range `r` such that $x ≡ y (mod n)$, where `n = length(r)`, i.e. `y = mod(x - first(r), n) + first(r)`.

See also [`mod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod(0, Base.OneTo(3))  # mod1(0, 3)
3

0
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


```
mod(x, y)
rem(x, y, RoundDown)
```

The reduction of `x` modulo `y`, or equivalently, the remainder of `x` after floored division by `y`, i.e. `x - y*fld(x,y)` if computed without intermediate rounding.

The result will have the same sign as `y`, and magnitude less than `abs(y)` (with some exceptions, see note below).

!!! note
    When used with floating point values, the exact result may not be representable by the type, and so rounding error may occur. In particular, if the exact result is very close to `y`, then it may be rounded to `y`.

rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```
```
mod1(x, y)
```

Modulus after flooring division, returning a value `r` such that `mod(r, y) == mod(x, y)` in the range $(0, y]$ for positive `y` and in the range $[y,0)$ for negative `y`.

With integer arguments and positive `y`, this is equal to `mod(x, 1:y)`, and hence natural for 1-based indexing. By comparison, `mod(x, y) == mod(x, 0:y-1)` is natural for computations with offsets or strides.

See also [`mod`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```
```
mod2pi(x)
```

Modulus after division by `2π`, returning in the range $[0,2π)$.

This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact `2π`, and is therefore not exactly the same as `mod(x,2π)`, which would compute the modulus of `x` relative to division by the floating-point number `2π`.

!!! note
    Depending on the format of the input value, the closest representable value to 2π may be less than 2π. For example, the expression `mod2pi(2π)` will not return `0`, because the intermediate value of `2*π` is a `Float64` and `2*Float64(π) < 2*big(π)`. See [`rem2pi`](@ref) for more refined control of this behavior.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod2pi(9*pi/4)
0.7853981633974481
```
```
modf(x)
```

Return a tuple `(fpart, ipart)` of the fractional and integral parts of a number. Both parts have the same sign as the argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> modf(3.5)
(0.5, 3.0)

julia> modf(-3.5)
(-0.5, -3.0)
```
```
modifyproperty!(x, f::Symbol, op, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic! max(a().b, c)` returns `modifyproperty!(a(), :b, max, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where the first argument must be a `getfield` expression and is modified atomically.

See also [`modifyfield!`](@ref Core.modifyfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
mtime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mtime`.
```
muladd(x, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add: computes `x*y+z`, but allowing the add and multiply to be merged with each other or with surrounding operations for performance. For example, this may be implemented as an [`fma`](@ref) if the hardware supports it efficiently. The result can be different on different machines and can also be different on the same machine due to constant propagation or other optimizations. See [`fma`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> muladd(3, 2, 1)
7

julia> 3 * 2 + 1
7
```

```
muladd(A, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add, `A*y .+ z`, for matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. The result is always the same size as `A*y`, but `z` may be smaller, or a scalar.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    These methods require Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest

```
```
mv(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false)
```

Move the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`. Return `dst`.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> write("hello.txt", "world");

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
"goodbye.txt"

julia> "hello.txt" in readdir()

nameof(m::Module) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a `Module` as a [`Symbol`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nameof(Base.Broadcast)
:Broadcast
```

```
nameof(t::DataType) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType` (without its parent module) as a symbol.

# Examples

```jldoctest

           struct S{T}
           end
       end
Foo

julia> nameof(Foo.S{T} where T)
:S
```

```
nameof(f::Function) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a generic `Function` as a symbol. For anonymous functions, this is a compiler-generated name. For explicitly-declared subtypes of `Function`, it is the name of the function's type.
```
names(x::Module; all::Bool = false, imported::Bool = false)
```

Get an array of the names exported by a `Module`, excluding deprecated names. If `all` is true, then the list also includes non-exported names defined in the module, deprecated names, and compiler-generated names. If `imported` is true, then names explicitly imported from other modules are also included.

As a special case, all names defined in `Main` are considered "exported", since it is not idiomatic to explicitly export names from `Main`.

```
nand(x, y)
⊼(x, y)
```

Bitwise nand (not and) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊼ b` is a synonym for `nand(a,b)`, and `⊼` can be typed by tab-completing `\nand` or `\barwedge` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

ncodeunits(c::Char) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units required to encode a character as UTF-8. This is the number of bytes which will be printed if the character is written to an output stream, or `ncodeunits(string(c))` but computed efficiently.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 consider using `ncodeunits(string(c))`.


```
ncodeunits(s::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units in a string. Indices that are in bounds to access this string must satisfy `1 ≤ i ≤ ncodeunits(s)`. Not all such indices are valid – they may not be the start of a character, but they will return a code unit value when calling `codeunit(s,i)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ncodeunits("The Julia Language")
18

julia> ncodeunits("∫eˣ")
6

julia> ncodeunits('∫'), ncodeunits('e'), ncodeunits('ˣ')
(3, 1, 2)
```

```
ndigits(n::Integer; base::Integer=10, pad::Integer=1)
```

Compute the number of digits in integer `n` written in base `base` (`base` must not be in `[-1, 0, 1]`), optionally padded with zeros to a specified size (the result will never be less than `pad`).

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `nextfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`prevfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the smallest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `x < y`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.

See also: [`prevfloat`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref).
```
nextind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts after index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the next character; if `i` is not the start of a character, move forward until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `0` return `1`. If `i` is in bounds but greater or equal to `lastindex(str)` return `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `nextind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `nextind` would reach `ncodeunits(str)+1` then each remaining iteration increases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `nextind` can return a value greater than `ncodeunits(str)+1`.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `s` or is equal to `0`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextind("α", 0)
1

julia> nextind("α", 1)

nextpow(a, x)
```

The smallest `a^n` not less than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must be greater than 0.

nor(x, y)
⊽(x, y)
```

Bitwise nor (not or) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊽ b` is a synonym for `nor(a,b)`, and `⊽` can be typed by tab-completing `\nor` or `\barvee` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

"/home/example.jl"

julia> normpath("Documents/Julia") == joinpath("Documents", "Julia")
true
```

```
normpath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to a normalized path by joining them together and removing "." and ".." entries. Equivalent to `normpath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)
```

Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them `val`. If `all` is `true` (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If `error` is `true`, the passed value is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

Return the count of tasks woken up. Return 0 if no tasks are waiting on `condition`.
```
ntoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Network byte order (big-endian) to that used by the Host.
```
ntuple(f::Function, n::Integer)
```

Create a tuple of length `n`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, 4)
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```
ntuple(f, ::Val{N})
```

Create a tuple of length `N`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element. By taking a `Val(N)` argument, it is possible that this version of ntuple may generate more efficient code than the version taking the length as an integer. But `ntuple(f, N)` is preferable to `ntuple(f, Val(N))` in cases where `N` cannot be determined at compile time.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, Val(4))
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```
```
numerator(x)
```

Numerator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```
```
objectid(x) -> UInt
```

Get a hash value for `x` based on object identity. `objectid(x)==objectid(y)` if `x === y`.

See also [`hash`](@ref), [`IdDict`](@ref).
```
occursin(needle::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern,AbstractChar}, haystack::AbstractString)
```

Determine whether the first argument is a substring of the second. If `needle` is a regular expression, checks whether `haystack` contains a match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> occursin("Julia", "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin('a', "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "aba")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "abba")
false
```

See also [`contains`](@ref).

```
occursin(haystack)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument occurs in `haystack`, i.e. a function equivalent to `needle -> occursin(needle, haystack)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(occursin)}`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
oftype(x, y)
```

Convert `y` to the type of `x` (`convert(typeof(x), y)`).

# Examples

julia> x = 4;

julia> y = 3.;

julia> oftype(x, y)
3

julia> oftype(y, x)
4.0
```
```
one(x)
one(T::type)
```

Return a multiplicative identity for `x`: a value such that `one(x)*x == x*one(x) == x`.  Alternatively `one(T)` can take a type `T`, in which case `one` returns a multiplicative identity for any `x` of type `T`.

If possible, `one(x)` returns a value of the same type as `x`, and `one(T)` returns a value of type `T`.  However, this may not be the case for types representing dimensionful quantities (e.g. time in days), since the multiplicative identity must be dimensionless.  In that case, `one(x)` should return an identity value of the same precision (and shape, for matrices) as `x`.

If you want a quantity that is of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`, even if `x` is dimensionful, use [`oneunit`](@ref) instead.

See also the [`identity`](@ref) function, and `I` in [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg) for the identity matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> one(3.7)

```
```
ones([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
ones([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all ones with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ones(1,2)
1×2 Matrix{Float64}:

 1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im
```
```
oneunit(x::T)
oneunit(T::Type)
```

Returns `T(one(x))`, where `T` is either the type of the argument or (if a type is passed) the argument.  This differs from [`one`](@ref) for dimensionful quantities: `one` is dimensionless (a multiplicative identity) while `oneunit` is dimensionful (of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> oneunit(3.7)
1.0

julia> import Dates; oneunit(Dates.Day)
1 day
```
```
only(x)

open(f::Function, args...; kwargs...)
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of `open(args...; kwargs...)` and close the resulting file descriptor upon completion.

# Examples

open(filename::AbstractString; lock = true, keywords...) -> IOStream
```

Open a file in a mode specified by five boolean keyword arguments:

| Keyword    | Description            | Default                               |
|:---------- |:---------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| `read`     | open for reading       | `!write`                              |
| `write`    | open for writing       | `truncate \| append`                  |
| `create`   | create if non-existent | `!read & write \| truncate \| append` |
| `truncate` | truncate to zero size  | `!read & write`                       |
| `append`   | seek to end            | `false`                               |

The default when no keywords are passed is to open files for reading only. Returns a stream for accessing the opened file.

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(filename::AbstractString, [mode::AbstractString]; lock = true) -> IOStream
```

Alternate syntax for open, where a string-based mode specifier is used instead of the five booleans. The values of `mode` correspond to those from `fopen(3)` or Perl `open`, and are equivalent to setting the following boolean groups:

| Mode | Description                   | Keywords                       |
|:---- |:----------------------------- |:------------------------------ |

| `a`  | write, create, append         | `append = true`                |
| `r+` | read, write                   | `read = true, write = true`    |
| `w+` | read, write, create, truncate | `truncate = true, read = true` |
| `a+` | read, write, create, append   | `append = true, read = true`   |

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "w");

julia> write(io, "Hello world!");

julia> close(io);

julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "r");

julia> read(io, String)
"Hello world!"

julia> write(io, "This file is read only")
ERROR: ArgumentError: write failed, IOStream is not writeable
[...]

julia> close(io)

julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "a");

julia> write(io, "This stream is not read only")
28

julia> close(io)

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(fd::OS_HANDLE) -> IO
```

Take a raw file descriptor wrap it in a Julia-aware IO type, and take ownership of the fd handle. Call `open(Libc.dup(fd))` to avoid the ownership capture of the original handle.

!!! warning
    Do not call this on a handle that's already owned by some other part of the system.


```
open(command, mode::AbstractString, stdio=devnull)
```

Run `command` asynchronously. Like `open(command, stdio; read, write)` except specifying the read and write flags via a mode string instead of keyword arguments. Possible mode strings are:

| Mode | Description | Keywords                    |
|:---- |:----------- |:--------------------------- |
| `r`  | read        | none                        |
| `w`  | write       | `write = true`              |
| `r+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |
| `w+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |

```
open(command, stdio=devnull; write::Bool = false, read::Bool = !write)
```

Start running `command` asynchronously, and return a `process::IO` object.  If `read` is true, then reads from the process come from the process's standard output and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard input stream.  If `write` is true, then writes go to the process's standard input and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard output stream. The process's standard error stream is connected to the current global `stderr`.

```
open(f::Function, command, args...; kwargs...)
```

Similar to `open(command, args...; kwargs...)`, but calls `f(stream)` on the resulting process stream, then closes the input stream and waits for the process to complete. Return the value returned by `f` on success. Throw an error if the process failed, or if the process attempts to print anything to stdout.
```
operm(file)
```

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions for people who neither own the file nor are a member of the group owning the file
```
pairs(collection)
```

Return an iterator over `key => value` pairs for any collection that maps a set of keys to a set of values. This includes arrays, where the keys are the array indices.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict(zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]))
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> pairs(a)
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> foreach(println, pairs(["a", "b", "c"]))
1 => "a"
2 => "b"
3 => "c"

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> pairs |> collect
3-element Vector{Pair{Symbol, Int64}}:
 :a => 1
 :b => 2
 :c => 3

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> collect
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
pairs(IndexLinear(), A)
pairs(IndexCartesian(), A)
pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
```

An iterator that accesses each element of the array `A`, returning `i => x`, where `i` is the index for the element and `x = A[i]`. Identical to `pairs(A)`, except that the style of index can be selected. Also similar to `enumerate(A)`, except `i` will be a valid index for `A`, while `enumerate` always counts from 1 regardless of the indices of `A`.

Specifying [`IndexLinear()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be an integer; specifying [`IndexCartesian()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be a [`CartesianIndex`](@ref); specifying `IndexStyle(A)` chooses whichever has been defined as the native indexing style for array `A`.

Mutation of the bounds of the underlying array will invalidate this iterator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = ["a" "d"; "b" "e"; "c" "f"];

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
4 d
5 e
6 f

julia> S = view(A, 1:2, :);

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(S), S)
           println("$index $value")
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1) a
CartesianIndex(2, 1) b
CartesianIndex(1, 2) d
CartesianIndex(2, 2) e
```

See also [`IndexStyle`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref).
```
parent(A)
```

Return the underlying "parent array”. This parent array of objects of types `SubArray`, `ReshapedArray` or `LinearAlgebra.Transpose` is what was passed as an argument to `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, etc. during object creation. If the input is not a wrapped object, return the input itself. If the input is wrapped multiple times, only the outermost wrapper will be removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> V = view(A, 1:2, :)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1:2, :) with eltype Int64:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(V)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
parentindices(A)
```

Return the indices in the [`parent`](@ref) which correspond to the array view `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> V = view(A, 1, :)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1, :) with eltype Int64:
 1
 2

julia> parentindices(V)
(1, Base.Slice(Base.OneTo(2)))
```
```
parentmodule(m::Module) -> Module
```

Get a module's enclosing `Module`. `Main` is its own parent.

See also: [`names`](@ref), [`nameof`](@ref), [`fullname`](@ref), [`@__MODULE__`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parentmodule(Main)
Main

julia> parentmodule(Base.Broadcast)
Base
```

```
parentmodule(t::DataType) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the definition of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct Int end
       end
Foo

julia> parentmodule(Int)
Core

julia> parentmodule(Foo.Int)
Foo
```

```
parentmodule(f::Function) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the (first) definition of a generic function.

```
parentmodule(f::Function, types) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing a given definition of a generic function.
```
parse(type, str; base)
```

Parse a string as a number. For `Integer` types, a base can be specified (the default is 10). For floating-point types, the string is parsed as a decimal floating-point number.  `Complex` types are parsed from decimal strings of the form `"R±Iim"` as a `Complex(R,I)` of the requested type; `"i"` or `"j"` can also be used instead of `"im"`, and `"R"` or `"Iim"` are also permitted. If the string does not contain a valid number, an error is raised.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `parse(Bool, str)` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse(Int, "1234")
1234

julia> parse(Int, "1234", base = 5)
194

julia> parse(Int, "afc", base = 16)
2812

julia> parse(Float64, "1.2e-3")
0.0012

julia> parse(Complex{Float64}, "3.2e-1 + 4.5im")
0.32 + 4.5im
```

```
parse(::Type{Platform}, triplet::AbstractString)
```

Parses a string platform triplet back into a `Platform` object.
```
partialsort(v, k, by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Variant of [`partialsort!`](@ref) which copies `v` before partially sorting it, thereby returning the same thing as `partialsort!` but leaving `v` unmodified.
```
partialsort!(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Partially sort the vector `v` in place, according to the order specified by `by`, `lt` and `rev` so that the value at index `k` (or range of adjacent values if `k` is a range) occurs at the position where it would appear if the array were fully sorted via a non-stable algorithm. If `k` is a single index, that value is returned; if `k` is a range, an array of values at those indices is returned. Note that `partialsort!` does not fully sort the input array.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4)
4

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 4

julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4, rev=true)
2

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
partialsortperm(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return a partial permutation `I` of the vector `v`, so that `v[I]` returns values of a fully sorted version of `v` at index `k`. If `k` is a range, a vector of indices is returned; if `k` is an integer, a single index is returned. The order is specified using the same keywords as `sort!`. The permutation is stable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

Note that this function is equivalent to, but more efficient than, calling `sortperm(...)[k]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> v[partialsortperm(v, 1)]
1

julia> p = partialsortperm(v, 1:3)
3-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 1:3) with eltype Int64:
 2
 4
 3

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
```
```
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false, initialized=false)
```

Like [`partialsortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix` the same size as `v`, which is used to store (a permutation of) the indices of `v`.

If the index vector `ix` is initialized with the indices of `v` (or a permutation thereof), `initialized` should be set to `true`.

If `initialized` is `false` (the default), then `ix` is initialized to contain the indices of `v`.

If `initialized` is `true`, but `ix` does not contain (a permutation of) the indices of `v`, the behavior of `partialsortperm!` is undefined.

(Typically, the indices of `v` will be `1:length(v)`, although if `v` has an alternative array type with non-one-based indices, such as an `OffsetArray`, `ix` must also be an `OffsetArray` with the same indices, and must contain as values (a permutation of) these same indices.)

Upon return, `ix` is guaranteed to have the indices `k` in their sorted positions, such that

```julia
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k);
v[ix[k]] == partialsort(v, k)
```

The return value is the `k`th element of `ix` if `k` is an integer, or view into `ix` if `k` is a range.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> ix = Vector{Int}(undef, 4);

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 1)
2

julia> ix = [1:4;];

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 2:3, initialized=true)
2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 2:3) with eltype Int64:
 4
 3
```

```

```
```
pathof(m::Module)
```

Return the path of the `m.jl` file that was used to `import` module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package.

Use [`dirname`](@ref) to get the directory part and [`basename`](@ref) to get the file name part of the path.
```
peek(stream[, T=UInt8])
```

Read and return a value of type `T` from a stream without advancing the current position in the stream.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = IOBuffer("julia");

julia> peek(b)
0x6a

julia> position(b)
0

julia> peek(b, Char)
'j': ASCII/Unicode U+006A (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The method which accepts a type requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
permute!(v, p)
```

Permute vector `v` in-place, according to permutation `p`. No checking is done to verify that `p` is a permutation.

To return a new permutation, use `v[p]`. Note that this is generally faster than `permute!(v,p)` for large vectors.

See also [`invpermute!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> permute!(A, perm);

julia> A
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 3
 1
```

```
permute!(X::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         p::AbstractVector{<:Integer}, q::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         [C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

Bilaterally permute `A`, storing result `PAQ` (`A[p,q]`) in `X`. Stores intermediate result `(AQ)^T` (`transpose(A[:,q])`) in optional argument `C` if present. Requires that none of `X`, `A`, and, if present, `C` alias each other; to store result `PAQ` back into `A`, use the following method lacking `X`:

```
permute!(A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, p::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         q::AbstractVector{<:Integer}[, C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         [workcolptr::Vector{Ti}]]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

`X`'s dimensions must match those of `A` (`size(X, 1) == size(A, 1)` and `size(X, 2) == size(A, 2)`), and `X` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(X)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(X)) >= nnz(A)`). Column-permutation `q`'s length must match `A`'s column count (`length(q) == size(A, 2)`). Row-permutation `p`'s length must match `A`'s row count (`length(p) == size(A, 1)`).

`C`'s dimensions must match those of `transpose(A)` (`size(C, 1) == size(A, 2)` and `size(C, 2) == size(A, 1)`), and `C` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(C)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(C)) >= nnz(A)`).

For additional (algorithmic) information, and for versions of these methods that forgo argument checking, see (unexported) parent methods `unchecked_noalias_permute!` and `unchecked_aliasing_permute!`.

See also [`permute`](@ref).
```
permutedims(A::AbstractArray, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `A`. `perm` is a vector or a tuple of length `ndims(A)` specifying the permutation.

See also [`permutedims!`](@ref), [`PermutedDimsArray`](@ref), [`transpose`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

[:, :, 2] =
 5  7
 6  8

julia> permutedims(A, (3, 2, 1))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 5  7

[:, :, 2] =
 2  4
 6  8

julia> B = randn(5, 7, 11, 13);

julia> perm = [4,1,3,2];

julia> size(permutedims(B, perm))
(13, 5, 11, 7)

julia> size(B)[perm] == ans
true
```

```
permutedims(m::AbstractMatrix)
```

Permute the dimensions of the matrix `m`, by flipping the elements across the diagonal of the matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> b = [5 6; 7 8];

julia> c = [9 10; 11 12];

julia> d = [13 14; 15 16];

julia> X = [[a] [b]; [c] [d]]
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]     [5 6; 7 8]
 [9 10; 11 12]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> permutedims(X)
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [9 10; 11 12]
 [5 6; 7 8]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> transpose(X)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [9 11; 10 12]
 [5 7; 6 8]  [13 15; 14 16]
```

```
permutedims(v::AbstractVector)
```

Reshape vector `v` into a `1 × length(v)` row matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> permutedims([1, 2, 3, 4])
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4

julia> V = [[[1 2; 3 4]]; [[5 6; 7 8]]]
2-element Vector{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]
 [5 6; 7 8]

julia> permutedims(V)
1×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [5 6; 7 8]

julia> transpose(V)
1×2 transpose(::Vector{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [5 7; 6 8]
```
```
permutedims!(dest, src, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `src` and store the result in the array `dest`. `perm` is a vector specifying a permutation of length `ndims(src)`. The preallocated array `dest` should have `size(dest) == size(src)[perm]` and is completely overwritten. No in-place permutation is supported and unexpected results will happen if `src` and `dest` have overlapping memory regions.

See also [`permutedims`](@ref).
```
pipeline(command; stdin, stdout, stderr, append=false)
```

Redirect I/O to or from the given `command`. Keyword arguments specify which of the command's streams should be redirected. `append` controls whether file output appends to the file. This is a more general version of the 2-argument `pipeline` function. `pipeline(from, to)` is equivalent to `pipeline(from, stdout=to)` when `from` is a command, and to `pipeline(to, stdin=from)` when `from` is another kind of data source.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`dothings`, stdout="out.txt", stderr="errs.txt"))
run(pipeline(`update`, stdout="log.txt", append=true))
```

```
pipeline(from, to, ...)
```

Create a pipeline from a data source to a destination. The source and destination can be commands, I/O streams, strings, or results of other `pipeline` calls. At least one argument must be a command. Strings refer to filenames. When called with more than two arguments, they are chained together from left to right. For example, `pipeline(a,b,c)` is equivalent to `pipeline(pipeline(a,b),c)`. This provides a more concise way to specify multi-stage pipelines.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`ls`, `grep xyz`))
run(pipeline(`ls`, "out.txt"))
run(pipeline("out.txt", `grep xyz`))
```
```
pkgdir(m::Module[, paths::String...])
```

Return the root directory of the package that imported module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package. Optionally further path component strings can be provided to construct a path within the package root.

```julia-repl
julia> pkgdir(Foo)
"/path/to/Foo.jl"

julia> pkgdir(Foo, "src", "file.jl")
"/path/to/Foo.jl/src/file.jl"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The optional argument `paths` requires at least Julia 1.7.

No documentation found.

Binding `pkgversion` does not exist.
```
pointer(array [, index])
```

Get the native address of an array or string, optionally at a given location `index`.

This function is "unsafe". Be careful to ensure that a Julia reference to `array` exists as long as this pointer will be used. The [`GC.@preserve`](@ref) macro should be used to protect the `array` argument from garbage collection within a given block of code.

Calling [`Ref(array[, index])`](@ref Ref) is generally preferable to this function as it guarantees validity.
```
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

Get the memory address of a Julia object as a `Ptr`. The existence of the resulting `Ptr` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the `Ptr` will be used.

This function may not be called on immutable objects, since they do not have stable memory addresses.

See also [`unsafe_pointer_to_objref`](@ref).
```
pop!(collection) -> item
```

Remove an item in `collection` and return it. If `collection` is an ordered container, the last item is returned; for unordered containers, an arbitrary element is returned.

See also: [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), and [`push!`](@ref).

# Examples

2

julia> S
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  1

julia> pop!(Dict(1=>2))
1 => 2
```

```
pop!(collection, key[, default])
```

Delete and return the mapping for `key` if it exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>3);

julia> pop!(d, "a")
1

julia> pop!(d, "d")
ERROR: KeyError: key "d" not found
Stacktrace:
[...]

julia> pop!(d, "e", 4)
4
```
```
popat!(a::Vector, i::Integer, [default])
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return it. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap. When `i` is not a valid index for `a`, return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

See also: [`pop!`](@ref), [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

popdisplay()
popdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pop the topmost backend off of the display-backend stack, or the topmost copy of `d` in the second variant.
```
popfirst!(collection) -> item

```

Compute $x^p \pmod m$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> powermod(2, 6, 5)
4

julia> mod(2^6, 5)
4

julia> powermod(5, 2, 20)
5

julia> powermod(5, 2, 19)

```
```
precision(num::AbstractFloat; base::Integer=2)
precision(T::Type; base::Integer=2)
```

Get the precision of a floating point number, as defined by the effective number of bits in the significand, or the precision of a floating-point type `T` (its current default, if `T` is a variable-precision type like [`BigFloat`](@ref)).

If `base` is specified, then it returns the maximum corresponding number of significand digits in that base.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
precompile(f, args::Tuple{Vararg{Any}})
```

Compile the given function `f` for the argument tuple (of types) `args`, but do not execute it.
```
prepend!(a::Vector, collections...) -> collection
```

Insert the elements of each `collections` to the beginning of `a`.

When `collections` specifies multiple collections, order is maintained: elements of `collections[1]` will appear leftmost in `a`, and so on.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Specifying multiple collections to be prepended requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prepend!([3], [1, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> prepend!([6], [1, 2], [3, 4, 5])
6-element Vector{Int64}:

```
```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `prevfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`nextfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the largest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `y < x`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `-Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.
```
prevind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts before index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the previous character; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `1` return `0`. If `i` is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1` return `lastindex(str)`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `prevind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `prevind` would reach `0` then each remaining iteration decreases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `prevind` can return a negative value.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `str` or is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevind("α", 3)
1

julia> prevind("α", 1)
0

julia> prevind("α", 0)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [0]
[...]

julia> prevind("α", 2, 2)
0

julia> prevind("α", 2, 3)
-1
```
```
prevpow(a, x)
```

The largest `a^n` not greater than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must not be less than 1.

See also [`nextpow`](@ref), [`isqrt`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevpow(2, 7)
4

julia> prevpow(2, 9)
8

julia> prevpow(5, 20)
5

julia> prevpow(4, 16)
16
```
```
!(x)
```

Boolean not. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if `x` is `missing`.

See also [`~`](@ref) for bitwise not.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> !true
false

julia> !false
true

julia> !missing
missing

julia> .![true false true]
1×3 BitMatrix:
 0  1  0
```

```
!f::Function
```

Predicate function negation: when the argument of `!` is a function, it returns a function which computes the boolean negation of `f`.

See also [`∘`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0: |x-y| < δ ⇒ |f(x)-f(y)| < ε"
"∀ ε > 0, ∃ δ > 0: |x-y| < δ ⇒ |f(x)-f(y)| < ε"

julia> filter(isletter, str)
"εδxyδfxfyε"

julia> filter(!isletter, str)
"∀  > 0, ∃  > 0: |-| <  ⇒ |()-()| < "
```
```
!=(x, y)
≠(x,y)
```

Not-equals comparison operator. Always gives the opposite answer as [`==`](@ref).

# Implementation

New types should generally not implement this, and rely on the fallback definition `!=(x,y) = !(x==y)` instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 != 2
true

julia> "foo" ≠ "foo"
false
```

```
!=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`!=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y != x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(!=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
!==(x, y)
≢(x,y)
```

Always gives the opposite answer as [`===`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2];

julia> a ≢ b
true

julia> a ≢ a
false
```
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
x & y
```

Bitwise and. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `true`. Add parentheses for function application form: `(&)(x, y)`.

See also: [`|`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`&&`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 & 10
0

julia> 4 & 12
4

julia> true & missing
missing

julia> false & missing
false
```
```
A'
adjoint(A)
```

Lazy adjoint (conjugate transposition). Note that `adjoint` is applied recursively to elements.

For number types, `adjoint` returns the complex conjugate, and therefore it is equivalent to the identity function for real numbers.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> adjoint(A)
2×2 adjoint(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3-2im  8-7im
 9-2im  4-6im

julia> x = [3, 4im]
2-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 3 + 0im
 0 + 4im

julia> x'x
25 + 0im
```
```
*(s::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, t::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}...) -> AbstractString
```

Concatenate strings and/or characters, producing a [`String`](@ref). This is equivalent to calling the [`string`](@ref) function on the arguments. Concatenation of built-in string types always produces a value of type `String` but other string types may choose to return a string of a different type as appropriate.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Hello " * "world"
"Hello world"

julia> 'j' * "ulia"
"julia"
```

```
*(s::Regex, t::Union{Regex,AbstractString,AbstractChar}) -> Regex
*(s::Union{Regex,AbstractString,AbstractChar}, t::Regex) -> Regex
```

Concatenate regexes, strings and/or characters, producing a [`Regex`](@ref). String and character arguments must be matched exactly in the resulting regex, meaning that the contained characters are devoid of any special meaning (they are quoted with "\Q" and "\E").

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"Hello|Good bye" * ' ' * "world", "Hello world")
RegexMatch("Hello world")

julia> r = r"a|b" * "c|d"
r"(?:a|b)\Qc|d\E"

julia> match(r, "ac") == nothing
true

julia> match(r, "ac|d")
RegexMatch("ac|d")
```

```
*(x, y...)
```

Multiplication operator. `x*y*z*...` calls this function with all arguments, i.e. `*(x, y, z, ...)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 2 * 7 * 8
112

julia> *(2, 7, 8)
112
```

```
*(A::AbstractMatrix, B::AbstractMatrix)
```

Matrix multiplication.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1 1; 0 1] * [1 0; 1 1]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 1  1
```

```
*(A, B::AbstractMatrix, C)
A * B * C * D
```

Chained multiplication of 3 or 4 matrices is done in the most efficient sequence, based on the sizes of the arrays. That is, the number of scalar multiplications needed for `(A * B) * C` (with 3 dense matrices) is compared to that for `A * (B * C)` to choose which of these to execute.

If the last factor is a vector, or the first a transposed vector, then it is efficient to deal with these first. In particular `x' * B * y` means `(x' * B) * y` for an ordinary column-major `B::Matrix`. Unlike `dot(x, B, y)`, this allocates an intermediate array.

If the first or last factor is a number, this will be fused with the matrix multiplication, using 5-arg [`mul!`](@ref).

See also [`muladd`](@ref), [`dot`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    These optimisations require at least Julia 1.7.

```
+(x, y...)
```

Addition operator. `x+y+z+...` calls this function with all arguments, i.e. `+(x, y, z, ...)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 1 + 20 + 4
25

julia> +(1, 20, 4)
25
```

```
dt::Date + t::Time -> DateTime
```

The addition of a `Date` with a `Time` produces a `DateTime`. The hour, minute, second, and millisecond parts of the `Time` are used along with the year, month, and day of the `Date` to create the new `DateTime`. Non-zero microseconds or nanoseconds in the `Time` type will result in an `InexactError` being thrown.
```
-(x)
```

Unary minus operator.

See also: [`abs`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> -1
-1

julia> -(2)
-2

julia> -[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1  -2
 -3  -4
```

```
-(x, y)
```

Subtraction operator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 2 - 3
-1

julia> -(2, 4.5)
-2.5
```
```
/(x, y)
```

Right division operator: multiplication of `x` by the inverse of `y` on the right. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 1/2
0.5

julia> 4/2
2.0

julia> 4.5/2
2.25
```

```
A / B
```

Matrix right-division: `A / B` is equivalent to `(B' \ A')'` where [`\`](@ref) is the left-division operator. For square matrices, the result `X` is such that `A == X*B`.

See also: [`rdiv!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Float64[1 4 5; 3 9 2]; B = Float64[1 4 2; 3 4 2; 8 7 1];

julia> X = A / B
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 -0.65   3.75  -1.2
  3.25  -2.75   1.0

julia> isapprox(A, X*B)
true

julia> isapprox(X, A*pinv(B))
true
```
```
//(num, den)
```

Divide two integers or rational numbers, giving a [`Rational`](@ref) result.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 // 5
3//5

julia> (3 // 5) // (2 // 1)
3//10
```
```
Colon()
```

Colons (:) are used to signify indexing entire objects or dimensions at once.

Very few operations are defined on Colons directly; instead they are converted by [`to_indices`](@ref) to an internal vector type (`Base.Slice`) to represent the collection of indices they span before being used.

The singleton instance of `Colon` is also a function used to construct ranges; see [`:`](@ref).
```
<(x, y)
```

Less-than comparison operator. Falls back to [`isless`](@ref). Because of the behavior of floating-point NaN values, this operator implements a partial order.

# Implementation

New numeric types with a canonical partial order should implement this function for two arguments of the new type. Types with a canonical total order should implement [`isless`](@ref) instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' < 'b'
true

julia> "abc" < "abd"
true

julia> 5 < 3
false
```

```
<(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y < x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
<:(T1, T2)
```

Subtype operator: returns `true` if and only if all values of type `T1` are also of type `T2`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Float64 <: AbstractFloat
true

julia> Vector{Int} <: AbstractArray
true

julia> Matrix{Float64} <: Matrix{AbstractFloat}
false
```
```
<<(x, n)
```

Left bit shift operator, `x << n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted left by `n` bits, filling with `0`s. This is equivalent to `x * 2^n`. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x >> -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(3) << 2
12

julia> bitstring(Int8(3))
"00000011"

julia> bitstring(Int8(12))
"00001100"
```

See also [`>>`](@ref), [`>>>`](@ref), [`exp2`](@ref), [`ldexp`](@ref).

```
<<(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Left bit shift operator, `B << n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `B` with elements shifted `n` positions backwards, filling with `false` values. If `n < 0`, elements are shifted forwards. Equivalent to `B >> -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> B = BitVector([true, false, true, false, false])
5-element BitVector:
 1
 0
 1
 0
 0

julia> B << 1
5-element BitVector:
 0

julia> B << -1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 1
 0
```
```
<=(x, y)
≤(x,y)
```

Less-than-or-equals comparison operator. Falls back to `(x < y) | (x == y)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' <= 'b'
true

julia> 7 ≤ 7 ≤ 9
true

julia> "abc" ≤ "abc"
true

julia> 5 <= 3
false
```

```
<=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y <= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
==(x, y)
```

Generic equality operator. Falls back to [`===`](@ref). Should be implemented for all types with a notion of equality, based on the abstract value that an instance represents. For example, all numeric types are compared by numeric value, ignoring type. Strings are compared as sequences of characters, ignoring encoding. For collections, `==` is generally called recursively on all contents, though other properties (like the shape for arrays) may also be taken into account.

This operator follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers: `0.0 == -0.0` and `NaN != NaN`.

The result is of type `Bool`, except when one of the operands is [`missing`](@ref), in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)). For collections, `missing` is returned if at least one of the operands contains a `missing` value and all non-missing values are equal. Use [`isequal`](@ref) or [`===`](@ref) to always get a `Bool` result.

# Implementation

New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.

[`isequal`](@ref) falls back to `==`, so new methods of `==` will be used by the [`Dict`](@ref) type to compare keys. If your type will be used as a dictionary key, it should therefore also implement [`hash`](@ref).

If some type defines `==`, [`isequal`](@ref), and [`isless`](@ref) then it should also implement [`<`](@ref) to ensure consistency of comparisons.

```
==(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`==`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y == x`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(==)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
==(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether two strings are equal character by character (technically, Unicode code point by code point).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "abc" == "abc"
true

julia> "abc" == "αβγ"
false
```
```
>(x, y)
```

Greater-than comparison operator. Falls back to `y < x`.

# Implementation

Generally, new types should implement [`<`](@ref) instead of this function, and rely on the fallback definition `>(x, y) = y < x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' > 'b'
false

julia> 7 > 3 > 1
true

julia> "abc" > "abd"
false

julia> 5 > 3
true
```

```
>(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`>`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y > x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(>)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
>:(T1, T2)
```

Supertype operator, equivalent to `T2 <: T1`.
```
>=(x, y)
≥(x,y)
```

Greater-than-or-equals comparison operator. Falls back to `y <= x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' >= 'b'
false

julia> 7 ≥ 7 ≥ 3
true

julia> "abc" ≥ "abc"
true

julia> 5 >= 3
true
```

```
>=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`>=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y >= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(>=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
>>(x, n)
```

Right bit shift operator, `x >> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted right by `n` bits, where `n >= 0`, filling with `0`s if `x >= 0`, `1`s if `x < 0`, preserving the sign of `x`. This is equivalent to `fld(x, 2^n)`. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x << -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(13) >> 2
3

julia> bitstring(Int8(13))
"00001101"

julia> bitstring(Int8(3))
"00000011"

julia> Int8(-14) >> 2
-4

julia> bitstring(Int8(-14))
"11110010"

julia> bitstring(Int8(-4))
"11111100"
```

See also [`>>>`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

```
>>(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Right bit shift operator, `B >> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `B` with elements shifted `n` positions forward, filling with `false` values. If `n < 0`, elements are shifted backwards. Equivalent to `B << -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> B = BitVector([true, false, true, false, false])
5-element BitVector:
 1
 0
 1
 0
 0

julia> B >> 1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 1
 0

julia> B >> -1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 0
 0
```
```
>>>(x, n)
```

Unsigned right bit shift operator, `x >>> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted right by `n` bits, where `n >= 0`, filling with `0`s. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x << -n`.

For [`Unsigned`](@ref) integer types, this is equivalent to [`>>`](@ref). For [`Signed`](@ref) integer types, this is equivalent to `signed(unsigned(x) >> n)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(-14) >>> 2
60

julia> bitstring(Int8(-14))
"11110010"

julia> bitstring(Int8(60))
"00111100"
```

[`BigInt`](@ref)s are treated as if having infinite size, so no filling is required and this is equivalent to [`>>`](@ref).

See also [`>>`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

```
>>>(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Unsigned right bitshift operator, `B >>> n`. Equivalent to `B >> n`. See [`>>`](@ref) for details and examples.
```
@MIME_str
```

A convenience macro for writing [`MIME`](@ref) types, typically used when adding methods to [`show`](@ref). For example the syntax `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/html", x::MyType) = ...` could be used to define how to write an HTML representation of `MyType`.
```
@NamedTuple{key1::Type1, key2::Type2, ...}
@NamedTuple begin key1::Type1; key2::Type2; ...; end
```

This macro gives a more convenient syntax for declaring `NamedTuple` types. It returns a `NamedTuple` type with the given keys and types, equivalent to `NamedTuple{(:key1, :key2, ...), Tuple{Type1,Type2,...}}`. If the `::Type` declaration is omitted, it is taken to be `Any`.   The `begin ... end` form allows the declarations to be split across multiple lines (similar to a `struct` declaration), but is otherwise equivalent.

For example, the tuple `(a=3.1, b="hello")` has a type `NamedTuple{(:a, :b),Tuple{Float64,String}}`, which can also be declared via `@NamedTuple` as:

```jldoctest
julia> @NamedTuple{a::Float64, b::String}
NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Float64, String}}

julia> @NamedTuple begin
           a::Float64
           b::String
       end
NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Float64, String}}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.5.

```
@__DIR__ -> AbstractString
```

Expand to a string with the absolute path to the directory of the file containing the macrocall. Return the current working directory if run from a REPL or if evaluated by `julia -e <expr>`.
```
@__FILE__ -> AbstractString
```

Expand to a string with the path to the file containing the macrocall, or an empty string if evaluated by `julia -e <expr>`. Return `nothing` if the macro was missing parser source information. Alternatively see [`PROGRAM_FILE`](@ref).
```
@__LINE__ -> Int
```

Expand to the line number of the location of the macrocall. Return `0` if the line number could not be determined.
```
@__MODULE__ -> Module
```

Get the `Module` of the toplevel eval, which is the `Module` code is currently being read from.
```
@. expr
```

Convert every function call or operator in `expr` into a "dot call" (e.g. convert `f(x)` to `f.(x)`), and convert every assignment in `expr` to a "dot assignment" (e.g. convert `+=` to `.+=`).

If you want to *avoid* adding dots for selected function calls in `expr`, splice those function calls in with `$`.  For example, `@. sqrt(abs($sort(x)))` is equivalent to `sqrt.(abs.(sort(x)))` (no dot for `sort`).

(`@.` is equivalent to a call to `@__dot__`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1.0:3.0; y = similar(x);

julia> @. y = x + 3 * sin(x)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 3.5244129544236893
 4.727892280477045
 3.4233600241796016
```
```
@allocated
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the total number of bytes allocated during evaluation of the expression.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@elapsed`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @allocated rand(10^6)
8000080
```
No documentation found.

Binding `@allocations` does not exist.
```
@assert cond [text]
```

Throw an [`AssertionError`](@ref) if `cond` is `false`. Preferred syntax for writing assertions. Message `text` is optionally displayed upon assertion failure.

!!! warning
    An assert might be disabled at various optimization levels. Assert should therefore only be used as a debugging tool and not used for authentication verification (e.g., verifying passwords), nor should side effects needed for the function to work correctly be used inside of asserts.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @assert iseven(3) "3 is an odd number!"
ERROR: AssertionError: 3 is an odd number!

julia> @assert isodd(3) "What even are numbers?"
```
```
@async
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) and add it to the local machine's scheduler queue.

Values can be interpolated into `@async` via `$`, which copies the value directly into the constructed underlying closure. This allows you to insert the *value* of a variable, isolating the asynchronous code from changes to the variable's value in the current task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Interpolating values via `$` is available as of Julia 1.4.

```
@atomic var
@atomic order ex
```

Mark `var` or `ex` as being performed atomically, if `ex` is a supported expression.

```
@atomic a.b.x = new
@atomic a.b.x += addend
@atomic :release a.b.x = new
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x += addend
```

Perform the store operation expressed on the right atomically and return the new value.

With `=`, this operation translates to a `setproperty!(a.b, :x, new)` call. With any operator also, this operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, +, addend)[2]` call.

```
@atomic a.b.x max arg2
@atomic a.b.x + arg2
@atomic max(a.b.x, arg2)
@atomic :acquire_release max(a.b.x, arg2)
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x + arg2
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x max arg2
```

Perform the binary operation expressed on the right atomically. Store the result into the field in the first argument and return the values `(old, new)`.

This operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, func, arg2)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

```jldoctest
julia> mutable struct Atomic{T}; @atomic x::T; end

julia> a = Atomic(1)
Atomic{Int64}(1)

julia> @atomic a.x # fetch field x of a, with sequential consistency
1

julia> @atomic :sequentially_consistent a.x = 2 # set field x of a, with sequential consistency
2

julia> @atomic a.x += 1 # increment field x of a, with sequential consistency
3

julia> @atomic a.x + 1 # increment field x of a, with sequential consistency
3 => 4

julia> @atomic a.x # fetch field x of a, with sequential consistency
4

julia> @atomic max(a.x, 10) # change field x of a to the max value, with sequential consistency
4 => 10

julia> @atomic a.x max 5 # again change field x of a to the max value, with sequential consistency
10 => 10
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.7.

```
@atomicreplace a.b.x expected => desired
@atomicreplace :sequentially_consistent a.b.x expected => desired
@atomicreplace :sequentially_consistent :monotonic a.b.x expected => desired
```

Perform the conditional replacement expressed by the pair atomically, returning the values `(old, success::Bool)`. Where `success` indicates whether the replacement was completed.

This operation translates to a `replaceproperty!(a.b, :x, expected, desired)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

```jldoctest
julia> mutable struct Atomic{T}; @atomic x::T; end

julia> a = Atomic(1)
Atomic{Int64}(1)

julia> @atomicreplace a.x 1 => 2 # replace field x of a with 2 if it was 1, with sequential consistency
(old = 1, success = true)

julia> @atomic a.x # fetch field x of a, with sequential consistency
2

julia> @atomicreplace a.x 1 => 2 # replace field x of a with 2 if it was 1, with sequential consistency
(old = 2, success = false)

julia> xchg = 2 => 0; # replace field x of a with 0 if it was 1, with sequential consistency

julia> @atomicreplace a.x xchg
(old = 2, success = true)

julia> @atomic a.x # fetch field x of a, with sequential consistency
0
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.7.

```
@atomicswap a.b.x = new
@atomicswap :sequentially_consistent a.b.x = new
```

Stores `new` into `a.b.x` and returns the old value of `a.b.x`.

This operation translates to a `swapproperty!(a.b, :x, new)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

```jldoctest
julia> mutable struct Atomic{T}; @atomic x::T; end

julia> a = Atomic(1)
Atomic{Int64}(1)

julia> @atomicswap a.x = 2+2 # replace field x of a with 4, with sequential consistency
1

julia> @atomic a.x # fetch field x of a, with sequential consistency
4
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.7.

```
@b_str
```

Create an immutable byte (`UInt8`) vector using string syntax.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = b"12\x01\x02"
4-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x31
 0x32
 0x01
 0x02

julia> v[2]
0x32
```
```
@big_str str
@big_str(str)
```

Parse a string into a [`BigInt`](@ref) or [`BigFloat`](@ref), and throw an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid number. For integers `_` is allowed in the string as a separator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big"123_456"
123456

julia> big"7891.5"
7891.5
```
```
@boundscheck(blk)
```

Annotates the expression `blk` as a bounds checking block, allowing it to be elided by [`@inbounds`](@ref).

!!! note
    The function in which `@boundscheck` is written must be inlined into its caller in order for `@inbounds` to have effect.


# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> @inline function g(A, i)
           @boundscheck checkbounds(A, i)
           return "accessing ($A)[$i]"
       end;

julia> f1() = return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f2() = @inbounds return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f1()
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-element UnitRange{Int64} at index [-1]
Stacktrace:
 [1] throw_boundserror(::UnitRange{Int64}, ::Tuple{Int64}) at ./abstractarray.jl:455

 [4] f1() at ./none:1
 [5] top-level scope

julia> f2()
"accessing (1:2)[-1]"
```

!!! warning
    The `@boundscheck` annotation allows you, as a library writer, to opt-in to allowing *other code* to remove your bounds checks with [`@inbounds`](@ref). As noted there, the caller must verify—using information they can access—that their accesses are valid before using `@inbounds`. For indexing into your [`AbstractArray`](@ref) subclasses, for example, this involves checking the indices against its [`axes`](@ref). Therefore, `@boundscheck` annotations should only be added to a [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) implementation after you are certain its behavior is correct.

```
@ccall library.function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall $function_pointer(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
```

Call a function in a C-exported shared library, specified by `library.function_name`, where `library` is a string constant or literal. The library may be omitted, in which case the `function_name` is resolved in the current process. Alternatively, `@ccall` may also be used to call a function pointer `$function_pointer`, such as one returned by `dlsym`.

Each `argvalue` to `@ccall` is converted to the corresponding `argtype`, by automatic insertion of calls to `unsafe_convert(argtype, cconvert(argtype, argvalue))`. (See also the documentation for [`unsafe_convert`](@ref Base.unsafe_convert) and [`cconvert`](@ref Base.cconvert) for further details.) In most cases, this simply results in a call to `convert(argtype, argvalue)`.

# Examples

```
@ccall strlen(s::Cstring)::Csize_t
```

This calls the C standard library function:

```
size_t strlen(char *)
```

with a Julia variable named `s`. See also `ccall`.

Varargs are supported with the following convention:

```
@ccall printf("%s = %d"::Cstring ; "foo"::Cstring, foo::Cint)::Cint
```

The semicolon is used to separate required arguments (of which there must be at least one) from variadic arguments.

Example using an external library:

```
# C signature of g_uri_escape_string:
# char *g_uri_escape_string(const char *unescaped, const char *reserved_chars_allowed, gboolean allow_utf8);

const glib = "libglib-2.0"
@ccall glib.g_uri_escape_string(my_uri::Cstring, ":/"::Cstring, true::Cint)::Cstring
```

The string literal could also be used directly before the function name, if desired `"libglib-2.0".g_uri_escape_string(...`
```
@cfunction(callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> Ptr{Cvoid}
@cfunction($callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> CFunction
```

Generate a C-callable function pointer from the Julia function `callable` for the given type signature. To pass the return value to a `ccall`, use the argument type `Ptr{Cvoid}` in the signature.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression (although it can include a splat expression). And that these arguments will be evaluated in global scope during compile-time (not deferred until runtime). Adding a '$' in front of the function argument changes this to instead create a runtime closure over the local variable `callable` (this is not supported on all architectures).

See [manual section on ccall and cfunction usage](@ref Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
           return x + y
       end

julia> @cfunction(foo, Int, (Int, Int))
Ptr{Cvoid} @0x000000001b82fcd0
```
```
@cmd str
```

Similar to `cmd`, generate a `Cmd` from the `str` string which represents the shell command(s) to be executed. The [`Cmd`](@ref) object can be run as a process and can outlive the spawning julia process (see `Cmd` for more).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cm = @cmd " echo 1 "
`echo 1`

julia> run(cm)
1
Process(`echo 1`, ProcessExited(0))
```
```
@coalesce(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); missing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @coalesce a f(2) f(3) error("`a` is still missing")
1

julia> b = missing;

julia> b = @coalesce b f(2) f(3) error("`b` is still missing")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: `b` is still missing
[...]
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@deprecate old new [export_old=true]
```

Deprecate method `old` and specify the replacement call `new`. Prevent `@deprecate` from exporting `old` by setting `export_old` to `false`. `@deprecate` defines a new method with the same signature as `old`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    As of Julia 1.5, functions defined by `@deprecate` do not print warning when `julia` is run without the `--depwarn=yes` flag set, as the default value of `--depwarn` option is `no`.  The warnings are printed from tests run by `Pkg.test()`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x)
old (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x) false
old (generic function with 1 method)
```
# Documentation

Functions, methods and types can be documented by placing a string before the definition:

```
"""
# The Foo Function
`foo(x)`: Foo the living hell out of `x`.
"""
foo(x) = ...
```

The `@doc` macro can be used directly to both set and retrieve documentation / metadata. The macro has special parsing so that the documented object may occur on the next line:

```
@doc "blah"
function foo() ...
```

By default, documentation is written as Markdown, but any object can be used as the first argument.

## Documenting objects after they are defined

You can document an object after its definition by

```
@doc "foo" function_to_doc
@doc "bar" TypeToDoc
```

For macros, the syntax is `@doc "macro doc" :(@Module.macro)` or `@doc "macro doc" :(string_macro"")` for string macros. Without the quote `:()` the expansion of the macro will be documented.

## Retrieving Documentation

You can retrieve docs for functions, macros and other objects as follows:

```
@doc foo
@doc @time
@doc md""
```

## Functions & Methods

Placing documentation before a method definition (e.g. `function foo() ...` or `foo() = ...`) will cause that specific method to be documented, as opposed to the whole function. Method docs are concatenated together in the order they were defined to provide docs for the function.
```
@elapsed
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the number of seconds it took to execute as a floating-point number.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@elapsed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@elapsed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @elapsed sleep(0.3)
0.301391426
```
```
@enum EnumName[::BaseType] value1[=x] value2[=y]
```

Create an `Enum{BaseType}` subtype with name `EnumName` and enum member values of `value1` and `value2` with optional assigned values of `x` and `y`, respectively. `EnumName` can be used just like other types and enum member values as regular values, such as

# Examples

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> @enum Fruit apple=1 orange=2 kiwi=3

julia> f(x::Fruit) = "I'm a Fruit with value: $(Int(x))"
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(apple)
"I'm a Fruit with value: 1"

julia> Fruit(1)
apple::Fruit = 1
```

Values can also be specified inside a `begin` block, e.g.

```julia
@enum EnumName begin
    value1
    value2
end
```

`BaseType`, which defaults to [`Int32`](@ref), must be a primitive subtype of `Integer`. Member values can be converted between the enum type and `BaseType`. `read` and `write` perform these conversions automatically. In case the enum is created with a non-default `BaseType`, `Integer(value1)` will return the integer `value1` with the type `BaseType`.

To list all the instances of an enum use `instances`, e.g.

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> instances(Fruit)
(apple, orange, kiwi)
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@eval [mod,] ex
```

Evaluate an expression with values interpolated into it using `eval`. If two arguments are provided, the first is the module to evaluate in.
```
@evalpoly(z, c...)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k z^{k-1} c[k]$ for the coefficients `c[1]`, `c[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `z`.  This macro expands to efficient inline code that uses either Horner's method or, for complex `z`, a more efficient Goertzel-like algorithm.

See also [`evalpoly`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @evalpoly(3, 1, 0, 1)
10

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 0, 1)
5

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 1, 1)
7
```
```
@fastmath expr
```

Execute a transformed version of the expression, which calls functions that may violate strict IEEE semantics. This allows the fastest possible operation, but results are undefined – be careful when doing this, as it may change numerical results.

This sets the [LLVM Fast-Math flags](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags), and corresponds to the `-ffast-math` option in clang. See [the notes on performance annotations](@ref man-performance-annotations) for more details.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @fastmath 1+2
3

julia> @fastmath(sin(3))
0.1411200080598672
```
```
@generated f
```

`@generated` is used to annotate a function which will be generated. In the body of the generated function, only types of arguments can be read (not the values). The function returns a quoted expression evaluated when the function is called. The `@generated` macro should not be used on functions mutating the global scope or depending on mutable elements.

See [Metaprogramming](@ref) for further details.

## Example:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else
               return :(x)
           end
       end
bar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar(4)
16

julia> bar("baz")
"baz"
```
```
@gensym
```

Generates a gensym symbol for a variable. For example, `@gensym x y` is transformed into `x = gensym("x"); y = gensym("y")`.
```
@goto name
```

`@goto name` unconditionally jumps to the statement at the location [`@label name`](@ref).

`@label` and `@goto` cannot create jumps to different top-level statements. Attempts cause an error. To still use `@goto`, enclose the `@label` and `@goto` in a block.
```
@html_str -> Docs.HTML
```

Create an `HTML` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> html"Julia"
HTML{String}("Julia")
```
```
@inbounds(blk)
```

Eliminates array bounds checking within expressions.

In the example below the in-range check for referencing element `i` of array `A` is skipped to improve performance.

```julia
function sum(A::AbstractArray)
    r = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in eachindex(A)
        @inbounds r += A[i]
    end
    return r
end
```

!!! warning
    Using `@inbounds` may return incorrect results/crashes/corruption for out-of-bounds indices. The user is responsible for checking it manually. Only use `@inbounds` when it is certain from the information locally available that all accesses are in bounds.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@inline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that this function is worth inlining.

Small functions typically do not need the `@inline` annotation, as the compiler does it automatically. By using `@inline` on bigger functions, an extra nudge can be given to the compiler to inline it.

`@inline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@inline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@inline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @inline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@inline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that calls within `block` are worth inlining.

```julia
# The compiler will try to inline `f`
@inline f(...)

# The compiler will try to inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@inline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @noinline function explicit_noinline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @inline explicit_noinline(args...) # will be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @noinline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @inline f(a0)  # the compiler will try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)          # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! warning
    Although a callsite annotation will try to force inlining in regardless of the cost model, there are still chances it can't succeed in it. Especially, recursive calls can not be inlined even if they are annotated as `@inline`d.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
@int128_str str

@isdefined s -> Bool
```

Tests whether variable `s` is defined in the current scope.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @isdefined newvar

```
@label name
```

Labels a statement with the symbolic label `name`. The label marks the end-point of an unconditional jump with [`@goto name`](@ref).
```
lazy"str"
```

Create a [`LazyString`](@ref) using regular string interpolation syntax. Note that interpolations are *evaluated* at LazyString construction time, but *printing* is delayed until the first access to the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    `lazy"str"` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

```
@lock l expr
```

Macro version of `lock(f, l::AbstractLock)` but with `expr` instead of `f` function. Expands to:

```julia
lock(l)
try
    expr
finally
    unlock(l)
end
```

This is similar to using [`lock`](@ref) with a `do` block, but avoids creating a closure and thus can improve the performance.
```
@macroexpand
```

Return equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded).

There are differences between `@macroexpand` and [`macroexpand`](@ref).

  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) takes a keyword argument `recursive`, `@macroexpand` is always recursive. For a non recursive macro version, see [`@macroexpand1`](@ref).
  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) has an explicit `module` argument, `@macroexpand` always expands with respect to the module in which it is called.

This is best seen in the following example:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m()
               1
           end
           function f()
               (@macroexpand(@m),
                macroexpand(M, :(@m)),
                macroexpand(Main, :(@m))
               )
           end
       end
M

julia> macro m()
           2
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> M.f()
(1, 1, 2)
```

With `@macroexpand` the expression expands where `@macroexpand` appears in the code (module `M` in the example). With `macroexpand` the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.
```
@macroexpand1
```

Non recursive version of [`@macroexpand`](@ref).
```
@noinline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline a function.

Small functions are typically inlined automatically. By using `@noinline` on small functions, auto-inlining can be prevented.

`@noinline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@noinline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@noinline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @noinline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@noinline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline the calls within `block`.

```julia
# The compiler will try to not inline `f`
@noinline f(...)

# The compiler will try to not inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@noinline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @inline function explicit_inline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @noinline explicit_inline(args...) # will not be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @inline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @noinline f(a0)  # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)            # the compiler will try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

!!! note
    If the function is trivial (for example returning a constant) it might get inlined anyway.

```
@nospecialize
```

Applied to a function argument name, hints to the compiler that the method should not be specialized for different types of that argument, but instead to use precisely the declared type for each argument. This is only a hint for avoiding excess code generation. Can be applied to an argument within a formal argument list, or in the function body. When applied to an argument, the macro must wrap the entire argument expression. When used in a function body, the macro must occur in statement position and before any code.

When used without arguments, it applies to all arguments of the parent scope. In local scope, this means all arguments of the containing function. In global (top-level) scope, this means all methods subsequently defined in the current module.

Specialization can reset back to the default by using [`@specialize`](@ref).

```julia
function example_function(@nospecialize x)
    ...
end

function example_function(x, @nospecialize(y = 1))
    ...
end

function example_function(x, y, z)
    @nospecialize x y
    ...
end

@nospecialize
f(y) = [x for x in y]
@specialize
```
```
@polly
```

Tells the compiler to apply the polyhedral optimizer Polly to a function.
```
@r_str -> Regex
```

Construct a regex, such as `r"^[a-z]*$"`, without interpolation and unescaping (except for quotation mark `"` which still has to be escaped). The regex also accepts one or more flags, listed after the ending quote, to change its behaviour:

  * `i` enables case-insensitive matching
  * `m` treats the `^` and `$` tokens as matching the start and end of individual lines, as opposed to the whole string.
  * `s` allows the `.` modifier to match newlines.
  * `x` enables "comment mode": whitespace is enabled except when escaped with `\`, and `#` is treated as starting a comment.
  * `a` disables `UCP` mode (enables ASCII mode). By default `\B`, `\b`, `\D`, `\d`, `\S`, `\s`, `\W`, `\w`, etc. match based on Unicode character properties. With this option, these sequences only match ASCII characters.

See [`Regex`](@ref) if interpolation is needed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"a+.*b+.*?d$"ism, "Goodbye,\nOh, angry,\nBad world\n")
RegexMatch("angry,\nBad world")
```

This regex has the first three flags enabled.
```
@raw_str -> String
```

Create a raw string without interpolation and unescaping. The exception is that quotation marks still must be escaped. Backslashes escape both quotation marks and other backslashes, but only when a sequence of backslashes precedes a quote character. Thus, 2n backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes and the end of the literal while 2n+1 backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes followed by a quote character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println(raw"\ $x")
\ $x

julia> println(raw"\"")
"

julia> println(raw"\\\"")
\"

julia> println(raw"\\x \\\"")
\\x \"
```
```
@s_str -> SubstitutionString
```

Construct a substitution string, used for regular expression substitutions.  Within the string, sequences of the form `\N` refer to the Nth capture group in the regex, and `\g<groupname>` refers to a named capture group with name `groupname`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> msg = "#Hello# from Julia";

julia> replace(msg, r"#(.+)# from (?<from>\w+)" => s"FROM: \g<from>; MESSAGE: \1")
"FROM: Julia; MESSAGE: Hello"
```
```
@show exs...
```

Prints one or more expressions, and their results, to `stdout`, and returns the last result.

See also: [`show`](@ref), [`@info`](@ref man-logging), [`println`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = @show 1+2
1 + 2 = 3
3

julia> @show x^2 x/2;
x ^ 2 = 9
x / 2 = 1.5
```
```
@showtime expr
```

Like `@time` but also prints the expression being evaluated for reference.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This macro was added in Julia 1.8.


See also [`@time`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @showtime sleep(1)
sleep(1): 1.002164 seconds (4 allocations: 128 bytes)
```
```
@simd
```

Annotate a `for` loop to allow the compiler to take extra liberties to allow loop re-ordering

!!! warning
    This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia. Incorrect use of the `@simd` macro may cause unexpected results.


The object iterated over in a `@simd for` loop should be a one-dimensional range. By using `@simd`, you are asserting several properties of the loop:

  * It is safe to execute iterations in arbitrary or overlapping order, with special consideration for reduction variables.
  * Floating-point operations on reduction variables can be reordered, possibly causing different results than without `@simd`.

In many cases, Julia is able to automatically vectorize inner for loops without the use of `@simd`. Using `@simd` gives the compiler a little extra leeway to make it possible in more situations. In either case, your inner loop should have the following properties to allow vectorization:

  * The loop must be an innermost loop
  * The loop body must be straight-line code. Therefore, [`@inbounds`](@ref) is   currently needed for all array accesses. The compiler can sometimes turn   short `&&`, `||`, and `?:` expressions into straight-line code if it is safe   to evaluate all operands unconditionally. Consider using the [`ifelse`](@ref)   function instead of `?:` in the loop if it is safe to do so.
  * Accesses must have a stride pattern and cannot be "gathers" (random-index   reads) or "scatters" (random-index writes).
  * The stride should be unit stride.

!!! note
    The `@simd` does not assert by default that the loop is completely free of loop-carried memory dependencies, which is an assumption that can easily be violated in generic code. If you are writing non-generic code, you can use `@simd ivdep for ... end` to also assert that:


  * There exists no loop-carried memory dependencies
  * No iteration ever waits on a previous iteration to make forward progress.
```
@something(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); nothing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @something a f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `a`")
1

julia> b = nothing;

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `b`")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: Unable to find default for `b`
[...]

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) Some(nothing)
f(2)
f(3)

julia> b === nothing
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@specialize
```

Reset the specialization hint for an argument back to the default. For details, see [`@nospecialize`](@ref).
```
@static
```

Partially evaluate an expression at parse time.

For example, `@static Sys.iswindows() ? foo : bar` will evaluate `Sys.iswindows()` and insert either `foo` or `bar` into the expression. This is useful in cases where a construct would be invalid on other platforms, such as a `ccall` to a non-existent function. `@static if Sys.isapple() foo end` and `@static foo <&&,||> bar` are also valid syntax.
```
@sync
```

Wait until all lexically-enclosed uses of `@async`, `@spawn`, `@spawnat` and `@distributed` are complete. All exceptions thrown by enclosed async operations are collected and thrown as a `CompositeException`.
```
@task
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) without executing it, and return the [`Task`](@ref). This only creates a task, and does not run it.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a1() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = @task a1();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
@text_str -> Docs.Text
```

Create a `Text` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> text"Julia"
Julia
```
```
@threadcall((cfunc, clib), rettype, (argtypes...), argvals...)
```

The `@threadcall` macro is called in the same way as [`ccall`](@ref) but does the work in a different thread. This is useful when you want to call a blocking C function without causing the main `julia` thread to become blocked. Concurrency is limited by size of the libuv thread pool, which defaults to 4 threads but can be increased by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable and restarting the `julia` process.

Note that the called function should never call back into Julia.
```
@time expr
@time "description" expr
```

A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations, and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression. Any time spent garbage collecting (gc), compiling new code, or recompiling invalidated code is shown as a percentage.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@time` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@time @eval ...`.

See also [`@showtime`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

!!! note
    For more serious benchmarking, consider the `@btime` macro from the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The option to add a description was introduced in Julia 1.8.

    Recompilation time being shown separately from compilation time was introduced in Julia 1.8

```
```
@timed
```

A macro to execute an expression, and return the value of the expression, elapsed time, total bytes allocated, garbage collection time, and an object with various memory allocation counters.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@timed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@timed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```
@v_str
```

String macro used to parse a string to a [`VersionNumber`](@ref).

# Examples

```
@view A[inds...]
```

Transform the indexing expression `A[inds...]` into the equivalent [`view`](@ref) call.

This can only be applied directly to a single indexing expression and is particularly helpful for expressions that include the special `begin` or `end` indexing syntaxes like `A[begin, 2:end-1]` (as those are not supported by the normal [`view`](@ref) function).

Note that `@view` cannot be used as the target of a regular assignment (e.g., `@view(A[1, 2:end]) = ...`), nor would the un-decorated [indexed assignment](@ref man-indexed-assignment) (`A[1, 2:end] = ...`) or broadcasted indexed assignment (`A[1, 2:end] .= ...`) make a copy.  It can be useful, however, for *updating* broadcasted assignments like `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .+= 1` because this is a simple syntax for `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .= @view(A[1, 2:end]) + 1`, and the indexing expression on the right-hand side would otherwise make a copy without the `@view`.

See also [`@views`](@ref) to switch an entire block of code to use views for non-scalar indexing.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = @view A[:, 1]
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1

julia> fill!(b, 0)

 0
 0

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4
```
```
@views expression
```

Convert every array-slicing operation in the given expression (which may be a `begin`/`end` block, loop, function, etc.) to return a view. Scalar indices, non-array types, and explicit [`getindex`](@ref) calls (as opposed to `array[...]`) are unaffected.

!!! note
    The `@views` macro only affects `array[...]` expressions that appear explicitly in the given `expression`, not array slicing that occurs in functions called by that code.


!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(3, 3);

julia> @views for row in 1:3
           b = A[row, :]
           b[:] .= row
       end

julia> A

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
PipeBuffer(data::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[]; maxsize::Integer = typemax(Int))
```

An [`IOBuffer`](@ref) that allows reading and performs writes by appending. Seeking and truncating are not supported. See [`IOBuffer`](@ref) for the available constructors. If `data` is given, creates a `PipeBuffer` to operate on a data vector, optionally specifying a size beyond which the underlying `Array` may not be grown.
```
\(x, y)
```

Left division operator: multiplication of `y` by the inverse of `x` on the left. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 \ 6
2.0

julia> inv(3) * 6
2.0

julia> A = [4 3; 2 1]; x = [5, 6];

julia> A \ x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0

julia> inv(A) * x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0
```

```
\(A, B)
```

Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices `A` and `B`, the result `X` is such that `A*X == B` when `A` is square. The solver that is used depends upon the structure of `A`.  If `A` is upper or lower triangular (or diagonal), no factorization of `A` is required and the system is solved with either forward or backward substitution. For non-triangular square matrices, an LU factorization is used.

For rectangular `A` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of `A` and a rank estimate of `A` based on the R factor.

When `A` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the `LDLt` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

See also: [`factorize`](@ref), [`pinv`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 0; 1 -2]; B = [32; -4];

julia> X = A \ B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 32.0
 18.0

julia> A * X == B
true
```

```
(\)(F::QRSparse, B::StridedVecOrMat)
```

Solve the least squares problem $\min\|Ax - b\|^2$ or the linear system of equations $Ax=b$ when `F` is the sparse QR factorization of $A$. A basic solution is returned when the problem is underdetermined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse([1,2,4], [1,1,1], [1.0,1.0,1.0], 4, 2)
4×2 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1.0   ⋅
 1.0   ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅
 1.0   ⋅

julia> qr(A)\fill(1.0, 4)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0
```
```
^(x, y)
```

Exponentiation operator. If `x` is a matrix, computes matrix exponentiation.

If `y` is an `Int` literal (e.g. `2` in `x^2` or `-3` in `x^-3`), the Julia code `x^y` is transformed by the compiler to `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y))`, to enable compile-time specialization on the value of the exponent. (As a default fallback we have `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y)) = ^(x,y)`, where usually `^ == Base.^` unless `^` has been defined in the calling namespace.) If `y` is a negative integer literal, then `Base.literal_pow` transforms the operation to `inv(x)^-y` by default, where `-y` is positive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3^5
243

julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> A^3
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 37   54
 81  118
```

```
^(s::Union{AbstractString,AbstractChar}, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a string or character `n` times. This can also be written as `repeat(s, n)`.

See also [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Test "^3
"Test Test Test "
```

```
^(s::Regex, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a regex `n` times.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> r"Test "^2
r"(?:Test ){2}"

julia> match(r"Test "^2, "Test Test ")
RegexMatch("Test Test ")
```

```

 2.71828  17.3673
 0.0      20.0855
```
```
__precompile__(isprecompilable::Bool)
```

Specify whether the file calling this function is precompilable, defaulting to `true`. If a module or file is *not* safely precompilable, it should call `__precompile__(false)` in order to throw an error if Julia attempts to precompile it.
```
abs(x)
```

The absolute value of `x`.

When `abs` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when `abs` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when `x == typemin(typeof(x))`, `abs(x) == x < 0`, not `-x` as might be expected.

See also: [`abs2`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref).

# Examples

```
abspath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to an absolute path by joining them together and adding the current directory if necessary. Equivalent to `abspath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
accumulate(op, A; dims::Integer, [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` along the dimension `dims` of `A` (providing `dims` is optional for vectors). An initial value `init` may optionally be provided by a keyword argument. See also [`accumulate!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

For common operations there are specialized variants of `accumulate`, see [`cumsum`](@ref), [`cumprod`](@ref). For a lazy version, see [`Iterators.accumulate`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
accumulate!(op, B, A; [dims], [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` on `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. Providing `dims` is optional for vectors.  If the keyword argument `init` is given, its value is used to instantiate the accumulation.

acos(x)
```

Compute the inverse cosine of `x`, where the output is in radians

```
acos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse cosine. Otherwise, the inverse cosine is determined by using [`log`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_1].

```
A'
adjoint(A)
```

Lazy adjoint (conjugate transposition). Note that `adjoint` is applied recursively to elements.

For number types, `adjoint` returns the complex conjugate, and therefore it is equivalent to the identity function for real numbers.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims).

```
```
argmin(r::AbstractRange)
```

Ranges can have multiple minimal elements. In that case `argmin` will return a minimal index, but not necessarily the first one.

```
argmin(f, domain)
```

Return a value `x` in the domain of `f` for which `f(x)` is minimised. If there are multiple minimal values for `f(x)` then the first one will be found.

`domain` must be a non-empty iterable.

`NaN` is treated as less than all other values except `missing`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This method requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
asyncmap(f, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Uses multiple concurrent tasks to map `f` over a collection (or multiple equal length collections). For multiple collection arguments, `f` is applied elementwise.

`ntasks` specifies the number of tasks to run concurrently. Depending on the length of the collections, if `ntasks` is unspecified, up to 100 tasks will be used for concurrent mapping.

`ntasks` can also be specified as a zero-arg function. In this case, the number of tasks to run in parallel is checked before processing every element and a new task started if the value of `ntasks_func` is greater than the current number of tasks.

If `batch_size` is specified, the collection is processed in batch mode. `f` must then be a function that must accept a `Vector` of argument tuples and must return a vector of results. The input vector will have a length of `batch_size` or less.

The following examples highlight execution in different tasks by returning the `objectid` of the tasks in which the mapping function is executed.

First, with `ntasks` undefined, each element is processed in a different task.

```
julia> tskoid() = objectid(current_task());

julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x6e15e66c75c75853
 0x440f8819a1baa682
 0x9fb3eeadd0c83985
 0xebd3e35fe90d4050
 0x29efc93edce2b961

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)))
5
```

With `ntasks=2` all elements are processed in 2 tasks.

```
julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)))
2
```

With `batch_size` defined, the mapping function needs to be changed to accept an array of argument tuples and return an array of results. `map` is used in the modified mapping function to achieve this.

```
julia> batch_func(input) = map(x->string("args_tuple: ", x, ", element_val: ", x[1], ", task: ", tskoid()), input)
batch_func (generic function with 1 method)

julia> asyncmap(batch_func, 1:5; ntasks=2, batch_size=2)
5-element Array{String,1}:
 "args_tuple: (1,), element_val: 1, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (2,), element_val: 2, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (3,), element_val: 3, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (4,), element_val: 4, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (5,), element_val: 5, task: 9118321258196414413"
```

!!! note
    Currently, all tasks in Julia are executed in a single OS thread co-operatively. Consequently, `asyncmap` is beneficial only when the mapping function involves any I/O - disk, network, remote worker invocation, etc.

```
asyncmap!(f, results, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Like [`asyncmap`](@ref), but stores output in `results` rather than returning a collection.
```
atan(y)
atan(y, x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively.

For one argument, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (1, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

For two arguments, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (*x*, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. This corresponds to a standard [`atan2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function. Note that by convention `atan(0.0,x)` is defined as $\pi$ and `atan(-0.0,x)` is defined as $-\pi$ when `x < 0`.

```
atan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse tangent. Otherwise, the inverse tangent is determined by using [`log`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_3].

```
atanh(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```

```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_6].

```
atexit(f)
```

Register a zero-argument function `f()` to be called at process exit. `atexit()` hooks are called in last in first out (LIFO) order and run before object finalizers.

Exit hooks are allowed to call `exit(n)`, in which case Julia will exit with exit code `n` (instead of the original exit code). If more than one exit hook calls `exit(n)`, then Julia will exit with the exit code corresponding to the last called exit hook that calls `exit(n)`. (Because exit hooks are called in LIFO order, "last called" is equivalent to "first registered".)
```
atreplinit(f)
```

Register a one-argument function to be called before the REPL interface is initialized in interactive sessions; this is useful to customize the interface. The argument of `f` is the REPL object. This function should be called from within the `.julia/config/startup.jl` initialization file.
```
axes(A, d)
```

Return the valid range of indices for array `A` along dimension `d`.

See also [`size`](@ref), and the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A, 2)
Base.OneTo(6)
```

# Usage note

Each of the indices has to be an `AbstractUnitRange{<:Integer}`, but at the same time can be a type that uses custom indices. So, for example, if you need a subset, use generalized indexing constructs like `begin`/`end` or [`firstindex`](@ref)/[`lastindex`](@ref):

```julia
ix = axes(v, 1)
ix[2:end]          # will work for eg Vector, but may fail in general
ix[(begin+1):end]  # works for generalized indexes
```

```
axes(A)
```

Return the tuple of valid indices for array `A`.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A)
(Base.OneTo(5), Base.OneTo(6), Base.OneTo(7))
```
```
backtrace()
```

Get a backtrace object for the current program point.
```
basename(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the file name part of a path.

!!! note
    This function differs slightly from the Unix `basename` program, where trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `$ basename /foo/bar/` returns `bar`, whereas `basename` in Julia returns an empty string `""`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> basename("/home/myuser/example.jl")
"example.jl"

julia> basename("/home/myuser/")
""
```

See also [`dirname`](@ref).
```
big(T::Type)
```

Compute the type that represents the numeric type `T` with arbitrary precision. Equivalent to `typeof(big(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big(Rational)
Rational{BigInt}

julia> big(Float64)
BigFloat

julia> big(Complex{Int})
Complex{BigInt}
```

```
big(x)
```

Convert a number to a maximum precision representation (typically [`BigInt`](@ref) or `BigFloat`). See [`BigFloat`](@ref BigFloat(::Any, rounding::RoundingMode)) for information about some pitfalls with floating-point numbers.
```
bind(chnl::Channel, task::Task)
```

Associate the lifetime of `chnl` with a task. `Channel` `chnl` is automatically closed when the task terminates. Any uncaught exception in the task is propagated to all waiters on `chnl`.

The `chnl` object can be explicitly closed independent of task termination. Terminating tasks have no effect on already closed `Channel` objects.

When a channel is bound to multiple tasks, the first task to terminate will close the channel. When multiple channels are bound to the same task, termination of the task will close all of the bound channels.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:4);

julia> bind(c,task);

julia> for i in c
           @show i
       end;
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4

julia> isopen(c)
false
```

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async (put!(c, 1); error("foo"));

julia> bind(c, task);

julia> take!(c)
1

julia> put!(c, 1);
ERROR: TaskFailedException
Stacktrace:
[...]
    nested task error: foo
[...]
```

```
bind(socket::Union{TCPServer, UDPSocket, TCPSocket}, host::IPAddr, port::Integer; ipv6only=false, reuseaddr=false, kws...)
```

Bind `socket` to the given `host:port`. Note that `0.0.0.0` will listen on all devices.

  * The `ipv6only` parameter disables dual stack mode. If `ipv6only=true`, only an IPv6 stack is created.
  * If `reuseaddr=true`, multiple threads or processes can bind to the same address without error if they all set `reuseaddr=true`, but only the last to bind will receive any traffic.
```
binomial(n::Integer, k::Integer)
```

The *binomial coefficient* $\binom{n}{k}$, being the coefficient of the $k$th term in the polynomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$.

If $n$ is non-negative, then it is the number of ways to choose `k` out of `n` items:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}
$$

where $n!$ is the [`factorial`](@ref) function.

If $n$ is negative, then it is defined in terms of the identity

$$
\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{k-n-1}{k}
$$

See also [`factorial`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> binomial(5, 3)
10

julia> factorial(5) ÷ (factorial(5-3) * factorial(3))
10

julia> binomial(-5, 3)
-35
```

bitreverse(x)
```

Reverse the order of bits in integer `x`. `x` must have a fixed bit width, e.g. be an `Int16` or `Int32`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


# Examples

true
```
```
bitrotate(x::Base.BitInteger, k::Integer)
```

`bitrotate(x, k)` implements bitwise rotation. It returns the value of `x` with its bits rotated left `k` times. A negative value of `k` will rotate to the right instead.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
bitstring(n)
```

```
```
broadcast(f, As...)
```

Broadcast the function `f` over the arrays, tuples, collections, [`Ref`](@ref)s and/or scalars `As`.

Broadcasting applies the function `f` over the elements of the container arguments and the scalars themselves in `As`. Singleton and missing dimensions are expanded to match the extents of the other arguments by virtually repeating the value. By default, only a limited number of types are considered scalars, including `Number`s, `String`s, `Symbol`s, `Type`s, `Function`s and some common singletons like [`missing`](@ref) and [`nothing`](@ref). All other arguments are iterated over or indexed into elementwise.

The resulting container type is established by the following rules:

  * If all the arguments are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns an unwrapped scalar.
  * If at least one argument is a tuple and all others are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns a tuple.
  * All other combinations of arguments default to returning an `Array`, but custom container types can define their own implementation and promotion-like rules to customize the result when they appear as arguments.

A special syntax exists for broadcasting: `f.(args...)` is equivalent to `broadcast(f, args...)`, and nested `f.(g.(args...))` calls are fused into a single broadcast loop.

4-element Vector{String}:

```
```
broadcast!(f, dest, As...)
```

Like [`broadcast`](@ref), but store the result of `broadcast(f, As...)` in the `dest` array. Note that `dest` is only used to store the result, and does not supply arguments to `f` unless it is also listed in the `As`, as in `broadcast!(f, A, A, B)` to perform `A[:] = broadcast(f, A, B)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1.0; 0.0]; B = [0.0; 0.0];

julia> broadcast!(+, B, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> B
2-element Vector{Float64}:

```
```
bswap(n)
```

Reverse the byte order of `n`.

(See also [`ntoh`](@ref) and [`hton`](@ref) to convert between the current native byte order and big-endian order.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = bswap(0x10203040)

```
```
bytes2hex(itr) -> String
bytes2hex(io::IO, itr)
```

Convert an iterator `itr` of bytes to its hexadecimal string representation, either returning a `String` via `bytes2hex(itr)` or writing the string to an `io` stream via `bytes2hex(io, itr)`.  The hexadecimal characters are all lowercase.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `bytes2hex` with arbitrary iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `bytes2hex`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> b = hex2bytes(a)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> bytes2hex(b)
"3039"
```
```
bytesavailable(io)
```

Return the number of bytes available for reading before a read from this stream or buffer will block.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> bytesavailable(io)
34
```
```
cat(A...; dims)
```

Concatenate the input arrays along the specified dimensions in the iterable `dims`. For dimensions not in `dims`, all input arrays should have the same size, which will also be the size of the output array along that dimension. For dimensions in `dims`, the size of the output array is the sum of the sizes of the input arrays along that dimension. If `dims` is a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows one to construct block diagonal matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example, `cat(matrices...; dims=(1,2))` builds a block diagonal matrix, i.e. a block matrix with `matrices[1]`, `matrices[2]`, ... as diagonal blocks and matching zero blocks away from the diagonal.

See also [`hcat`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`hvcat`](@ref), [`repeat`](@ref).

```
```
catch_backtrace()
```

Get the backtrace of the current exception, for use within `catch` blocks.
```
cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```
```
cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Set the current working directory.

See also: [`pwd`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref), [`mkpath`](@ref), [`mktempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"

julia> cd()

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```

```
cd(f::Function, dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Temporarily change the current working directory to `dir`, apply function `f` and finally return to the original directory.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd(readdir, "/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")
34-element Array{String,1}:
 ".circleci"
 ".freebsdci.sh"

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```
```
ceil([T,] x)
ceil(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
ceil(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`ceil(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is greater than or equal to `x`.

`ceil(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
ceil(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` greater than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-09-01

julia> ceil(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:45:00

julia> ceil(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

```
ceil(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` up to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
3 weeks

julia> ceil(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> ceil(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Cvoid])
```

Obtain a pointer to a global variable in a C-exported shared library, specified exactly as in [`ccall`](@ref). Returns a `Ptr{Type}`, defaulting to `Ptr{Cvoid}` if no `Type` argument is supplied. The values can be read or written by [`unsafe_load`](@ref) or [`unsafe_store!`](@ref), respectively.
```
checkbounds(Bool, A, I...)
```

Return `true` if the specified indices `I` are in bounds for the given array `A`. Subtypes of `AbstractArray` should specialize this method if they need to provide custom bounds checking behaviors; however, in many cases one can rely on `A`'s indices and [`checkindex`](@ref).

See also [`checkindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = rand(3, 3);

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 2)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 3, 4)
false

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3, 2:4)
false
```

```
checkbounds(A, I...)
```

Throw an error if the specified indices `I` are not in bounds for the given array `A`.
```
checkindex(Bool, inds::AbstractUnitRange, index)
```

Return `true` if the given `index` is within the bounds of `inds`. Custom types that would like to behave as indices for all arrays can extend this method in order to provide a specialized bounds checking implementation.

See also [`checkbounds`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 8)
true

julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 21)
false
```
```
chmod(path::AbstractString, mode::Integer; recursive::Bool=false)
```

Change the permissions mode of `path` to `mode`. Only integer `mode`s (e.g. `0o777`) are currently supported. If `recursive=true` and the path is a directory all permissions in that directory will be recursively changed. Return `path`.

!!! note
    Prior to Julia 1.6, this did not correctly manipulate filesystem ACLs  on Windows, therefore it would only set read-only bits on files.  It  now is able to manipulate ACLs.

```
chomp(s::AbstractString) -> SubString
```

Remove a single trailing newline from a string.

See also [`chop`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chomp("Hello\n")
"Hello"
```
```
chop(s::AbstractString; head::Integer = 0, tail::Integer = 1)
```

Remove the first `head` and the last `tail` characters from `s`. The call `chop(s)` removes the last character from `s`. If it is requested to remove more characters than `length(s)` then an empty string is returned.

See also [`chomp`](@ref), [`startswith`](@ref), [`first`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "March"
"March"

julia> chop(a)
"Marc"

julia> chop(a, head = 1, tail = 2)
"ar"

julia> chop(a, head = 5, tail = 5)
""
```
```
chopprefix(s::AbstractString, prefix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the prefix `prefix` from `s`. If `s` does not start with `prefix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopsuffix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "Ham")
"burger"

julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chopsuffix(s::AbstractString, suffix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the suffix `suffix` from `s`. If `s` does not end with `suffix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopprefix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "er")
"Hamburg"

julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chown(path::AbstractString, owner::Integer, group::Integer=-1)
```

Change the owner and/or group of `path` to `owner` and/or `group`. If the value entered for `owner` or `group` is `-1` the corresponding ID will not change. Only integer `owner`s and `group`s are currently supported. Return `path`.
```
circcopy!(dest, src)
```

Copy `src` to `dest`, indexing each dimension modulo its length. `src` and `dest` must have the same size, but can be offset in their indices; any offset results in a (circular) wraparound. If the arrays have overlapping indices, then on the domain of the overlap `dest` agrees with `src`.

See also: [`circshift`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> src = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> dest = OffsetArray{Int}(undef, (0:3,2:5))

julia> circcopy!(dest, src)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices 0:3×2:5:
 8  12  16  4
 5   9  13  1
 6  10  14  2
 7  11  15  3

julia> dest[1:3,2:4] == src[1:3,2:4]
true
```
```
circshift(A, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in an array. The second argument is a tuple or vector giving the amount to shift in each dimension, or an integer to shift only in the first dimension.

See also: [`circshift!`](@ref), [`circcopy!`](@ref), [`bitrotate`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14

```
```
circshift!(dest, src, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in `src`, storing the result in `dest`. `shifts` specifies the amount to shift in each dimension.

The `dest` array must be distinct from the `src` array (they cannot alias each other).

See also [`circshift`](@ref).
```
cis(x)
```

More efficient method for `exp(im*x)` by using Euler's formula: $cos(x) + i sin(x) = \exp(i x)$.

See also [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincos`](@ref), [`exp`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cis(π) ≈ -1
true
```

```
cis(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

More efficient method for `exp(im*A)` of square matrix `A` (especially if `A` is `Hermitian` or real-`Symmetric`).

See also [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincos`](@ref), [`exp`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Support for using `cis` with matrices was added in Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cis([π 0; 0 π]) ≈ -I
true
```
```
cispi(x)
```

More accurate method for `cis(pi*x)` (especially for large `x`).

See also [`cis`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref), [`exp`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> cispi(0.25 + 1im)
0.030556854645952924 + 0.030556854645952924im
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
clamp(x, lo, hi)
```

Return `x` if `lo <= x <= hi`. If `x > hi`, return `hi`. If `x < lo`, return `lo`. Arguments are promoted to a common type.

See also [`clamp!`](@ref), [`min`](@ref), [`max`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    `missing` as the first argument requires at least Julia 1.3.

```

```
clamp(x::Integer, r::AbstractUnitRange)
```

Clamp `x` to lie within range `r`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.

```
clamp!(array::AbstractArray, lo, hi)
```

Restrict values in `array` to the specified range, in-place. See also [`clamp`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    `missing` entries in `array` require at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> row = collect(-4:4)';

julia> clamp!(row, 0, Inf)
1×9 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 0  0  0  0  0  1  2  3  4

julia> clamp.((-4:4)', 0, Inf)
1×9 Matrix{Float64}:

```
```
cld(x, y)
```

Smallest integer larger than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundUp)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`fld`](@ref).

# Examples

```
```
close(stream)
```

Close an I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first.

```
close(c::Channel[, excp::Exception])
```

Close a channel. An exception (optionally given by `excp`), is thrown by:

  * [`put!`](@ref) on a closed channel.
  * [`take!`](@ref) and [`fetch`](@ref) on an empty, closed channel.
```
closewrite(stream)
```

Shutdown the write half of a full-duplex I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first. Notify the other end that no more data will be written to the underlying file. This is not supported by all IO types.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = Base.BufferStream(); # this never blocks, so we can read and write on the same Task

julia> write(io, "request");

julia> # calling `read(io)` here would block forever

julia> closewrite(io);

julia> read(io, String)
"request"
```
```
cmp(x,y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. Uses the total order implemented by `isless`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp(1, 2)
-1

julia> cmp(2, 1)
1

julia> cmp(2+im, 3-im)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching isless(::Complex{Int64}, ::Complex{Int64})
[...]
```

```
cmp(<, x, y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. The first argument specifies a less-than comparison function to use.

```
cmp(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Compare two strings. Return `0` if both strings have the same length and the character at each index is the same in both strings. Return `-1` if `a` is a prefix of `b`, or if `a` comes before `b` in alphabetical order. Return `1` if `b` is a prefix of `a`, or if `b` comes before `a` in alphabetical order (technically, lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp("abc", "abc")
0

julia> cmp("ab", "abc")
-1

julia> cmp("abc", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("ab", "ac")
-1

julia> cmp("ac", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("α", "a")
1

julia> cmp("b", "β")
-1
```
```
coalesce(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`missing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise return `missing`.

See also [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref), [`@coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> coalesce(missing, 1)
1

julia> coalesce(1, missing)
1

julia> coalesce(nothing, 1)  # returns `nothing`

julia> coalesce(missing, missing)
missing
```
```
code_lowered(f, types; generated=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Return an array of the lowered forms (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

If `generated` is `false`, the returned `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to fallback implementations. An error is thrown if no fallback implementation exists. If `generated` is `true`, these `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to the method bodies yielded by expanding the generators.

The keyword `debuginfo` controls the amount of code metadata present in the output.

Note that an error will be thrown if `types` are not leaf types when `generated` is `true` and any of the corresponding methods are an `@generated` method.
```
code_typed(f, types; kw...)
```

Returns an array of type-inferred lowered form (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

# Keyword Arguments

  * `optimize=true`: controls whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied.
  * `debuginfo=:default`: controls the amount of code metadata present in the output,

possible options are `:source` or `:none`.

# Internal Keyword Arguments

This section should be considered internal, and is only for who understands Julia compiler internals.

  * `world=Base.get_world_counter()`: optional, controls the world age to use when looking up methods,

use current world age if not specified.

  * `interp=Core.Compiler.NativeInterpreter(world)`: optional, controls the interpreter to use,

use the native interpreter Julia uses if not specified.

# Example

One can put the argument types in a tuple to get the corresponding `code_typed`.

```julia
julia> code_typed(+, (Float64, Float64))
1-element Vector{Any}:
 CodeInfo(
1 ─ %1 = Base.add_float(x, y)::Float64
└──      return %1
) => Float64
```
```
codepoint(c::AbstractChar) -> Integer
```

Return the Unicode codepoint (an unsigned integer) corresponding to the character `c` (or throw an exception if `c` does not represent a valid character). For `Char`, this is a `UInt32` value, but `AbstractChar` types that represent only a subset of Unicode may return a different-sized integer (e.g. `UInt8`).
```
codeunit(s::AbstractString) -> Type{<:Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}}
```

Return the code unit type of the given string object. For ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8 encoded strings, this would be `UInt8`; for UCS-2 and UTF-16 it would be `UInt16`; for UTF-32 it would be `UInt32`. The code unit type need not be limited to these three types, but it's hard to think of widely used string encodings that don't use one of these units. `codeunit(s)` is the same as `typeof(codeunit(s,1))` when `s` is a non-empty string.

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref).

```
codeunit(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}
```

Return the code unit value in the string `s` at index `i`. Note that

```
codeunit(s, i) :: codeunit(s)
```

I.e. the value returned by `codeunit(s, i)` is of the type returned by `codeunit(s)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = codeunit("Hello", 2)
0x65

julia> typeof(a)
UInt8
```

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
codeunits(s::AbstractString)
```

Obtain a vector-like object containing the code units of a string. Returns a `CodeUnits` wrapper by default, but `codeunits` may optionally be defined for new string types if necessary.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> codeunits("Juλia")
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x4a
 0x75
 0xce
 0xbb
 0x69
 0x61
```
```
collect(element_type, collection)
```

Return an `Array` with the given element type of all items in a collection or iterable. The result has the same shape and number of dimensions as `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(Float64, 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 3.0
 5.0
```

```
collect(collection)
```

Return an `Array` of all items in a collection or iterator. For dictionaries, returns `Pair{KeyType, ValType}`. If the argument is array-like or is an iterator with the [`HasShape`](@ref IteratorSize) trait, the result will have the same shape and number of dimensions as the argument.

Used by comprehensions to turn a generator into an `Array`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(1:2:13)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
 11
 13

julia> [x^2 for x in 1:8 if isodd(x)]
4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  9
 25
 49
```
```
complex(r, [i])
```

Convert real numbers or arrays to complex. `i` defaults to zero.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(7)
7 + 0im

julia> complex([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 2 + 0im
 3 + 0im
```

```
complex(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type which can represent a value of type `T` as a complex number. Equivalent to `typeof(complex(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(Complex{Int})
Complex{Int64}

julia> complex(Int)
Complex{Int64}
```
```
conj(z)
```

Compute the complex conjugate of a complex number `z`.

See also: [`angle`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj(1 + 3im)
1 - 3im
```

```
conj(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the complex conjugate of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `conj.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 0 - 2im
 3 - 4im

julia> conj(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Complex{Int64}, 0}:
2 + 1im
```
```
conj!(A)
```

Transform an array to its complex conjugate in-place.

julia> conj!(A);

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1-1im  2+1im
 2-2im  3-1im
```
```
contains(haystack::AbstractString, needle)
```

Return `true` if `haystack` contains `needle`. This is the same as `occursin(needle, haystack)`, but is provided for consistency with `startswith(haystack, needle)` and `endswith(haystack, needle)`.

See also [`occursin`](@ref), [`in`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", "Julia")
true

julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", 'a')
true

julia> contains("aba", r"a.a")
true

julia> contains("abba", r"a.a")
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `contains` function requires at least Julia 1.5.


```
contains(needle)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument contains `needle`, i.e. a function equivalent to `haystack -> contains(haystack, needle)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(contains)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
No documentation found.

Binding `contractuser` does not exist.
```
convert(T, x)
```

Convert `x` to a value of type `T`.

If `T` is an [`Integer`](@ref) type, an [`InexactError`](@ref) will be raised if `x` is not representable by `T`, for example if `x` is not integer-valued, or is outside the range supported by `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> convert(Int, 3.0)
3

julia> convert(Int, 3.5)
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(3.5)
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

If `T` is a [`AbstractFloat`](@ref) type, then it will return the closest value to `x` representable by `T`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1/3
0.3333333333333333

julia> convert(Float32, x)

If `T` is a collection type and `x` a collection, the result of `convert(T, x)` may alias all or part of `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = Int[1, 2, 3];

julia> y = convert(Vector{Int}, x);

julia> y === x
true
```

```
copy(x)
```

Create a shallow copy of `x`: the outer structure is copied, but not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a new array with identically-same elements as the original.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copyto!`](@ref).

```
copy(A::Transpose)
copy(A::Adjoint)
```

Eagerly evaluate the lazy matrix transpose/adjoint. Note that the transposition is applied recursively to elements.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2im; -3im 4]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0+2im
 0-3im  4+0im

julia> T = transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:

2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im
```
```
copy!(dst, src) -> dst
```

In-place [`copy`](@ref) of `src` into `dst`, discarding any pre-existing elements in `dst`. If `dst` and `src` are of the same type, `dst == src` should hold after the call. If `dst` and `src` are multidimensional arrays, they must have equal [`axes`](@ref).

See also [`copyto!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 this method is available from the `Future` standard library as `Future.copy!`.

```
copysign(x, y) -> z
```

Return `z` which has the magnitude of `x` and the same sign as `y`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> copysign(1, -2)
-1

julia> copysign(-1, 2)
1
```
```
copyto!(dest, do, src, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from collection `src` starting at offset `so`, to array `dest` starting at offset `do`. Return `dest`.

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractArray, src) -> dest
```

Copy all elements from collection `src` to array `dest`, whose length must be greater than or equal to the length `n` of `src`. The first `n` elements of `dest` are overwritten, the other elements are left untouched.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copy`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1., 0., 3., 0., 5.];

julia> y = zeros(7);

```

```
copyto!(dest, Rdest::CartesianIndices, src, Rsrc::CartesianIndices) -> dest
```

Copy the block of `src` in the range of `Rsrc` to the block of `dest` in the range of `Rdest`. The sizes of the two regions must match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(5, 5);

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> Ainds = CartesianIndices((2:3, 2:3));

julia> Binds = CartesianIndices(B);

 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
```

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractMatrix, src::UniformScaling)
```

Copies a [`UniformScaling`](@ref) onto a matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    In Julia 1.0 this method only supported a square destination matrix. Julia 1.1. added support for a rectangular matrix.

```
cos(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`cosd`], [`cospi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
cos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the cosine. Otherwise, the cosine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cos(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
cosc(x)
```

Compute $\cos(\pi x) / x - \sin(\pi x) / (\pi x^2)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$. This is the derivative of `sinc(x)`.
```
cosd(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```

Compute hyperbolic cosine of `x`.

```
cosh(A::AbstractMatrix)

```
coth(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cotangent of square matrix `A`.
```
count([f=identity,] itr; init=0) -> Integer
```

Count the number of elements in `itr` for which the function `f` returns `true`. If `f` is omitted, count the number of `true` elements in `itr` (which should be a collection of boolean values). `init` optionally specifies the value to start counting from and therefore also determines the output type.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


See also: [`any`](@ref), [`sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count(i->(4<=i<=6), [2,3,4,5,6])
3

julia> count([true, false, true, true])
3

julia> count(>(3), 1:7, init=0x03)
0x07
```

```
count(
    pattern::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return the number of matches for `pattern` in `string`. This is equivalent to calling `length(findall(pattern, string))` but more efficient.

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a character as the pattern requires at least Julia 1.7.


```
count([f=identity,] A::AbstractArray; dims=:)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the given dimensions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `dims` keyword was added in Julia 1.5.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=1)

 1  1

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 0
```
```
count!([f=identity,] r, A)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, writing the result into `r` in-place.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    inplace `count!` was added in Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count!(<=(2), [1 1], A)

```
```
count_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_ones(7)
3

julia> count_ones(Int32(-1))
32
```
```
count_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_zeros(Int32(2 ^ 16 - 1))
16

julia> count_zeros(-1)
0
```
```
countlines(io::IO; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
```

Read `io` until the end of the stream/file and count the number of lines. To specify a file pass the filename as the first argument. EOL markers other than `'\n'` are supported by passing them as the second argument.  The last non-empty line of `io` is counted even if it does not end with the EOL, matching the length returned by [`eachline`](@ref) and [`readlines`](@ref).

To count lines of a `String`, `countlines(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> eof(io) # counting lines moves the file pointer
true

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io, eol = '.')
1
```
```
cp(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, follow_symlinks::Bool=false)
```

Copy the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`.

If `follow_symlinks=false`, and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be created as a symbolic link. If `follow_symlinks=true` and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be a copy of the file or directory `src` refers to. Return `dst`.

!!! note
    The `cp` function is different from the `cp` command. The `cp` function always operates on the assumption that `dst` is a file, while the command does different things depending on whether `dst` is a directory or a file. Using `force=true` when `dst` is a directory will result in loss of all the contents present in the `dst` directory, and `dst` will become a file that has the contents of `src` instead.

```
csc(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
csc(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosecant of a square matrix `A`.

```
csch(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cosecant of `x`.

```
csch(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cosecant of square matrix `A`.
```
ctime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).ctime`.
```
cumprod(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product along the dimension `dim`. See also [`cumprod!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Int8[1 2 3; 4 5 6];

julia> cumprod(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2   3

```

```
cumprod(itr)
```

Cumulative product of an iterator.

See also [`cumprod!`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref), [`cumsum`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumprod` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumprod(fill(1//2, 3))
3-element Vector{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//2
 1//4
 1//8

julia> cumprod((1, 2, 1, 3, 1))
(1, 2, 2, 6, 6)

julia> cumprod("julia")
5-element Vector{String}:
 "j"
 "ju"
 "jul"
 "juli"
 "julia"
```
```
cumprod!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).

```
cumprod!(y::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)
```

Cumulative product of a vector `x`, storing the result in `y`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).
```
cumsum(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum along the dimension `dims`. See also [`cumsum!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> cumsum(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 5  7  9

julia> cumsum(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3   6
 4  9  15
```

!!! note
    The return array's `eltype` is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size  and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size. To preserve `eltype` of arrays with small signed or unsigned integer `accumulate(+, A)` should be used.

    ```jldoctest
    julia> cumsum(Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int64}:
     100
     128

    julia> accumulate(+,Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int8}:
      100
     -128
    ```

    In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is `Int64[100, 128]`. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in `Int8[100, -128]`.


```
cumsum(itr)
```

Cumulative sum of an iterator.

See also [`accumulate`](@ref) to apply functions other than `+`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumsum` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```
```
cumsum!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumsum`](@ref).
```
current_exceptions(task::Task=current_task(); [backtrace::Bool=true])
```

Get the stack of exceptions currently being handled. For nested catch blocks there may be more than one current exception in which case the most recently thrown exception is last in the stack. The stack is returned as an `ExceptionStack` which is an AbstractVector of named tuples `(exception,backtrace)`. If `backtrace` is false, the backtrace in each pair will be set to `nothing`.

Explicitly passing `task` will return the current exception stack on an arbitrary task. This is useful for inspecting tasks which have failed due to uncaught exceptions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function went by the experimental name `catch_stack()` in Julia 1.1–1.6, and had a plain Vector-of-tuples as a return type.

```
current_task()
```

Get the currently running [`Task`](@ref).
```
deepcopy(x)
```

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::IdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
```
deg2rad(x)
```

Convert `x` from degrees to radians.

See also: [`rad2deg`](@ref), [`sind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deg2rad(90)
1.5707963267948966
```
```
delete!(collection, key)
```

Delete the mapping for the given key in a collection, if any, and return the collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b")
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b") # d is left unchanged
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1
```
```
deleteat!(a::Vector, i::Integer)
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

See also: [`delete!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
deleteat!(a::Vector, inds)
```

Remove the items at the indices given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

`inds` can be either an iterator or a collection of sorted and unique integer indices, or a boolean vector of the same length as `a` with `true` indicating entries to delete.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)

```
```
detach(command)
```

Mark a command object so that it will be run in a new process group, allowing it to outlive the julia process, and not have Ctrl-C interrupts passed to it.
```
diff(A::AbstractVector)
diff(A::AbstractArray; dims::Integer)
```

Finite difference operator on a vector or a multidimensional array `A`. In the latter case the dimension to operate on needs to be specified with the `dims` keyword argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `diff` for arrays with dimension higher than 2 requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

digits([T<:Integer], n::Integer; base::T = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Return an array with element type `T` (default `Int`) of the digits of `n` in the given base, optionally padded with zeros to a specified size. More significant digits are at higher indices, such that `n == sum(digits[k]*base^(k-1) for k=1:length(digits))`.

See also [`ndigits`](@ref), [`digits!`](@ref), and for base 2 also [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

```
```
digits!(array, n::Integer; base::Integer = 10)
```

Fills an array of the digits of `n` in the given base. More significant digits are at higher indices. If the array length is insufficient, the least significant digits are filled up to the array length. If the array length is excessive, the excess portion is filled with zeros.

# Examples

```
dirname(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the directory part of a path. Trailing characters ('/' or '\') in the path are counted as part of the path.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dirname("/home/myuser")
"/home"

julia> dirname("/home/myuser/")
"/home/myuser"
```

See also [`basename`](@ref).
```
disable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Disable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function on the current task, for calling external code that may call julia code that is not interrupt safe. Intended to be called using `do` block syntax as follows:

```
disable_sigint() do
    # interrupt-unsafe code
    ...
end
```

This is not needed on worker threads (`Threads.threadid() != 1`) since the `InterruptException` will only be delivered to the master thread. External functions that do not call julia code or julia runtime automatically disable sigint during their execution.
```
diskstat(path=pwd())
```

Returns statistics in bytes about the disk that contains the file or directory pointed at by `path`. If no argument is passed, statistics about the disk that contains the current working directory are returned.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
display(x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
display(mime, x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

Display `x` using the topmost applicable display in the display stack, typically using the richest supported multimedia output for `x`, with plain-text [`stdout`](@ref) output as a fallback. The `display(d, x)` variant attempts to display `x` on the given display `d` only, throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if `d` cannot display objects of this type.

In general, you cannot assume that `display` output goes to `stdout` (unlike [`print(x)`](@ref) or [`show(x)`](@ref)).  For example, `display(x)` may open up a separate window with an image. `display(x)` means "show `x` in the best way you can for the current output device(s)." If you want REPL-like text output that is guaranteed to go to `stdout`, use [`show(stdout, "text/plain", x)`](@ref) instead.

There are also two variants with a `mime` argument (a MIME type string, such as `"image/png"`), which attempt to display `x` using the requested MIME type *only*, throwing a `MethodError` if this type is not supported by either the display(s) or by `x`. With these variants, one can also supply the "raw" data in the requested MIME type by passing `x::AbstractString` (for MIME types with text-based storage, such as text/html or application/postscript) or `x::Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types).

To customize how instances of a type are displayed, overload [`show`](@ref) rather than `display`, as explained in the manual section on [custom pretty-printing](@ref man-custom-pretty-printing).
```
displayable(mime) -> Bool
displayable(d::AbstractDisplay, mime) -> Bool
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given `mime` type (string) is displayable by any of the displays in the current display stack, or specifically by the display `d` in the second variant.
```
displaysize([io::IO]) -> (lines, columns)
```

Return the nominal size of the screen that may be used for rendering output to this `IO` object. If no input is provided, the environment variables `LINES` and `COLUMNS` are read. If those are not set, a default size of `(24, 80)` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> withenv("LINES" => 30, "COLUMNS" => 100) do
           displaysize()
       end
(30, 100)
```

To get your TTY size,

```julia-repl
julia> displaysize(stdout)
(34, 147)
```
```
div(x, y)

div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.

```
divrem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient and remainder from Euclidean division. Equivalent to `(div(x,y,r), rem(x,y,r))`. Equivalently, with the default value of `r`, this call is equivalent to `(x÷y, x%y)`.

See also: [`fldmod`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref).

```
```
download(url::AbstractString, [path::AbstractString = tempname()]) -> path
```

Download a file from the given url, saving it to the location `path`, or if not specified, a temporary path. Returns the path of the downloaded file.

!!! note
    Since Julia 1.6, this function is deprecated and is just a thin wrapper around `Downloads.download`. In new code, you should use that function directly instead of calling this.

```
dropdims(A; dims)
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with the dimensions specified by `dims` removed. `size(A,d)` must equal 1 for every `d` in `dims`, and repeated dimensions or numbers outside `1:ndims(A)` are forbidden.

The result shares the same underlying data as `A`, such that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

See also: [`reshape`](@ref), [`vec`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:4),(2,2,1,1))
2×2×1×1 Array{Int64, 4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =
 1  3

```
```
dump(x; maxdepth=8)
```

Show every part of the representation of a value. The depth of the output is truncated at `maxdepth`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct
           x
           y
       end

julia> x = MyStruct(1, (2,3));

julia> dump(x)

```
```
eachcol(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the second dimension of matrix `A`, returning the columns as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref) and [`eachslice`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> first(eachcol(a))
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:

 3

julia> collect(eachcol(a))
2-element Vector{SubArray{Int64, 1, Matrix{Int64}, Tuple{Base.Slice{Base.OneTo{Int64}}, Int64}, true}}:
 [1, 3]
 [2, 4]
```
```
eachindex(A...)
```

Create an iterable object for visiting each index of an `AbstractArray` `A` in an efficient manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, return a specialized Cartesian range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, return an iterator object supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

If you supply more than one `AbstractArray` argument, `eachindex` will create an iterable object that is fast for all arguments (a [`UnitRange`](@ref) if all inputs have fast linear indexing, a [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) otherwise). If the arrays have different sizes and/or dimensionalities, a `DimensionMismatch` exception will be thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> for i in eachindex(A) # linear indexing
           println(i)
       end

julia> for i in eachindex(view(A, 1:2, 1:1)) # Cartesian indexing
           println(i)
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1)
CartesianIndex(2, 1)
```
```
eachline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
eachline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Create an iterable `EachLine` object that will yield each line from an I/O stream or a file. Iteration calls [`readline`](@ref) on the stream argument repeatedly with `keep` passed through, determining whether trailing end-of-line characters are retained. When called with a file name, the file is opened once at the beginning of iteration and closed at the end. If iteration is interrupted, the file will be closed when the `EachLine` object is garbage collected.

To iterate over each line of a `String`, `eachline(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

[`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) can be used on an `EachLine` object to read the lines in reverse order (for files, buffers, and other I/O streams supporting [`seek`](@ref)), and [`first`](@ref) or [`last`](@ref) can be used to extract the initial or final lines, respectively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> for line in eachline("my_file.txt")
           print(line)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members.

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Julia 1.8 is required to use `Iterators.reverse` or `last` with `eachline` iterators.

```
eachmatch(r::Regex, s::AbstractString; overlap::Bool=false)
```

Search for all matches of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return an iterator over the matches. If `overlap` is `true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from distinct character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a.a"
r"a.a"

julia> m = eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a")
Base.RegexMatchIterator(r"a.a", "a1a2a3a", false)

julia> collect(m)
2-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")

julia> collect(eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a", overlap = true))
3-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a2a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")
```
```
eachrow(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the first dimension of vector or matrix `A`, returning the rows as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

2-element Vector{SubArray{Int64, 1, Matrix{Int64}, Tuple{Int64, Base.Slice{Base.OneTo{Int64}}}, true}}:
 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
```
```
eachslice(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Create a generator that iterates over dimensions `dims` of `A`, returning views that select all the data from the other dimensions in `A`.

Only a single dimension in `dims` is currently supported. Equivalent to `(view(A,:,:,...,i,:,: ...)) for i in axes(A, dims))`, where `i` is in position `dims`.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref), [`eachcol`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), and [`selectdim`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```
```
eachsplit(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
eachsplit(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm` and return an iterator over the substrings.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`split`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `eachsplit` function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> collect(eachsplit(a, "."))
2-element Vector{SubString}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
eltype(type)
```

Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating a collection of the given `type`. For dictionary types, this will be a `Pair{KeyType,ValType}`. The definition `eltype(x) = eltype(typeof(x))` is provided for convenience so that instances can be passed instead of types. However the form that accepts a type argument should be defined for new types.

See also: [`keytype`](@ref), [`typeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eltype(fill(1f0, (2,2)))
Float32

julia> eltype(fill(0x1, (2,2)))
UInt8
```
```
empty(x::Tuple)
```

Returns an empty tuple, `()`.

```
empty(v::AbstractVector, [eltype])
```

Create an empty vector similar to `v`, optionally changing the `eltype`.

See also: [`empty!`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
Float64[]

julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], String)
String[]
```

```
empty(a::AbstractDict, [index_type=keytype(a)], [value_type=valtype(a)])
```

Create an empty `AbstractDict` container which can accept indices of type `index_type` and values of type `value_type`. The second and third arguments are optional and default to the input's `keytype` and `valtype`, respectively. (If only one of the two types is specified, it is assumed to be the `value_type`, and the `index_type` we default to `keytype(a)`).

Custom `AbstractDict` subtypes may choose which specific dictionary type is best suited to return for the given index and value types, by specializing on the three-argument signature. The default is to return an empty `Dict`.
```
empty!(collection) -> collection
```

Remove all elements from a `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> empty!(A);

julia> A
Dict{String, Int64}()
```
```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with `suffix`. If `suffix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the last character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`startswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("Sunday", "day")
true
```

```
endswith(suffix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument ends with `suffix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> endswith(y, suffix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(endswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `endswith(suffix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith_julia = endswith("Julia");

julia> endswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> endswith_julia("JuliaLang")
false
```

```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with the regex pattern, `suffix`.

!!! note
    `endswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"...$", s)` is faster than `endswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`startswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("JuliaLang", r"Lang|Roberts")
true
```
```
enumerate(iter)
```

An iterator that yields `(i, x)` where `i` is a counter starting at 1, and `x` is the `i`th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values `x` over which you are iterating, but also the number of iterations so far. Note that `i` may not be valid for indexing `iter`; it's also possible that `x != iter[i]`, if `iter` has indices that do not start at 1. See the `pairs(IndexLinear(), iter)` method if you want to ensure that `i` is an index.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
```
```
eof(stream) -> Bool
```

Test whether an I/O stream is at end-of-file. If the stream is not yet exhausted, this function will block to wait for more data if necessary, and then return `false`. Therefore it is always safe to read one byte after seeing `eof` return `false`. `eof` will return `false` as long as buffered data is still available, even if the remote end of a connection is closed.
```
eps(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractFloat
eps()
```

Return the *machine epsilon* of the floating point type `T` (`T = Float64` by default). This is defined as the gap between 1 and the next largest value representable by `typeof(one(T))`, and is equivalent to `eps(one(T))`.  (Since `eps(T)` is a bound on the *relative error* of `T`, it is a "dimensionless" quantity like [`one`](@ref).)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps()
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(Float32)
1.1920929f-7

julia> 1.0 + eps()
1.0000000000000002

julia> 1.0 + eps()/2
1.0
```

```
eps(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the *unit in last place* (ulp) of `x`. This is the distance between consecutive representable floating point values at `x`. In most cases, if the distance on either side of `x` is different, then the larger of the two is taken, that is

```
eps(x) == max(x-prevfloat(x), nextfloat(x)-x)
```

The exceptions to this rule are the smallest and largest finite values (e.g. `nextfloat(-Inf)` and `prevfloat(Inf)` for [`Float64`](@ref)), which round to the smaller of the values.

The rationale for this behavior is that `eps` bounds the floating point rounding error. Under the default `RoundNearest` rounding mode, if $y$ is a real number and $x$ is the nearest floating point number to $y$, then

$$
|y-x| \leq \operatorname{eps}(x)/2.
$$

See also: [`nextfloat`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref), [`floatmax`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(1.0)
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(prevfloat(2.0))
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(2.0)

julia> x + eps(x)/2            # rounds up
Inf

julia> x + prevfloat(eps(x)/2) # rounds down

```

```
eps(::Type{DateTime}) -> Millisecond
eps(::Type{Date}) -> Day
eps(::Type{Time}) -> Nanosecond
eps(::TimeType) -> Period
```

Return the smallest unit value supported by the `TimeType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(DateTime)
1 millisecond

julia> eps(Date)
1 day

julia> eps(Time)
1 nanosecond
```
```
error(message::AbstractString)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.

```
error(msg...)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.
```
errormonitor(t::Task)
```

Print an error log to `stderr` if task `t` fails.
```
esc(e)
```

Only valid in the context of an [`Expr`](@ref) returned from a macro. Prevents the macro hygiene pass from turning embedded variables into gensym variables. See the [Macros](@ref man-macros) section of the Metaprogramming chapter of the manual for more details and examples.
```
escape_string(str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::AbstractString
escape_string(io, str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::Nothing
```

General escaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`.

Backslashes (`\`) are escaped with a double-backslash (`"\\"`). Non-printable characters are escaped either with their standard C escape codes, `"\0"` for NUL (if unambiguous), unicode code point (`"\u"` prefix) or hex (`"\x"` prefix).

The optional `esc` argument specifies any additional characters that should also be escaped by a prepending backslash (`"` is also escaped by default in the first form).

The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which are to be kept as they are. Notice that `esc` has precedence here.

See also [`unescape_string`](@ref) for the reverse operation.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The `keep` argument is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb")
"aaa\\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb"; keep = '\n')
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("\xfe\xff") # invalid utf-8
"\\xfe\\xff"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0')) # unambiguous
"ℵ\\0"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0','0')) # \0 would be ambiguous
"ℵ\\x000"
```
```
evalfile(path::AbstractString, args::Vector{String}=String[])
```

Load the file using [`include`](@ref), evaluate all expressions, and return the value of the last one.
```
evalpoly(x, p)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k x^{k-1} p[k]$ for the coefficients `p[1]`, `p[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `x`. Loops are unrolled at compile time if the number of coefficients is statically known, i.e. when `p` is a `Tuple`. This function generates efficient code using Horner's method if `x` is real, or using a Goertzel-like [^DK62] algorithm if `x` is complex.

Compute the matrix exponential of `A`, defined by

$$
e^A = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^n}{n!}.
$$

For symmetric or Hermitian `A`, an eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, otherwise the scaling and squaring algorithm (see [^H05]) is chosen.

expanduser(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

On Unix systems, replace a tilde character at the start of a path with the current user's home directory.
```
expm1(x)
```

Accurately compute $e^x-1$. It avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small values of x.

```
extrema(itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` element in a single pass, and return them as a 2-tuple.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). As a consequence, when `itr` is empty the returned `(mn, mx)` tuple will satisfy `mn ≥ mx`. When `init` is specified it may be used even for non-empty `itr`.

julia> extrema([]; init = (Inf, -Inf))
(Inf, -Inf)
```

```
extrema(f, itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` of `f` applied to each element in `itr` and return them as a 2-tuple. Only one pass is made over `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). It is used for non-empty collections. Note: it implies that, for empty `itr`, the returned value `(mn, mx)` satisfies `mn ≥ mx` even though for non-empty `itr` it  satisfies `mn ≤ mx`.  This is a "paradoxical" but yet expected result.

```
factorial(n::Integer)
```

Factorial of `n`. If `n` is an [`Integer`](@ref), the factorial is computed as an integer (promoted to at least 64 bits). Note that this may overflow if `n` is not small, but you can use `factorial(big(n))` to compute the result exactly in arbitrary precision.

See also [`binomial`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> factorial(6)
720

julia> factorial(21)
ERROR: OverflowError: 21 is too large to look up in the table; consider using `factorial(big(21))` instead

falses(dims)
```

Create a `BitArray` with all values set to `false`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> falses(2,3)
2×3 BitMatrix:
 0  0  0
 0  0  0
```
```
fd(stream)
```

Return the file descriptor backing the stream or file. Note that this function only applies to synchronous `File`'s and `IOStream`'s not to any of the asynchronous streams.
```
fdio([name::AbstractString, ]fd::Integer[, own::Bool=false]) -> IOStream
```

Create an [`IOStream`](@ref) object from an integer file descriptor. If `own` is `true`, closing this object will close the underlying descriptor. By default, an `IOStream` is closed when it is garbage collected. `name` allows you to associate the descriptor with a named file.
```
fetch(c::Channel)
```

Wait for and get the first available item from the channel. Does not remove the item. `fetch` is unsupported on an unbuffered (0-size) channel.

```
fetch(t::Task)
```

Wait for a Task to finish, then return its result value. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.

```
fetch(x::Future)
```

Wait for and get the value of a [`Future`](@ref). The fetched value is cached locally. Further calls to `fetch` on the same reference return the cached value. If the remote value is an exception, throws a [`RemoteException`](@ref) which captures the remote exception and backtrace.

```
fetch(c::RemoteChannel)
```

Wait for and get a value from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). Exceptions raised are the same as for a [`Future`](@ref). Does not remove the item fetched.
```
fieldcount(t::Type)
```

Get the number of fields that an instance of the given type would have. An error is thrown if the type is too abstract to determine this.
```
fieldname(x::DataType, i::Integer)
```

Get the name of field `i` of a `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fieldname(Rational, 1)
:num

julia> fieldname(Rational, 2)
:den
```
```
fieldnames(x::DataType)
```

Get a tuple with the names of the fields of a `DataType`.

See also [`propertynames`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fieldnames(Rational)
(:num, :den)

julia> fieldnames(typeof(1+im))
(:re, :im)
```
```
fieldoffset(type, i)
```

The byte offset of field `i` of a type relative to the data start. For example, we could use it in the following manner to summarize information about a struct:

```jldoctest
julia> structinfo(T) = [(fieldoffset(T,i), fieldname(T,i), fieldtype(T,i)) for i = 1:fieldcount(T)];

julia> structinfo(Base.Filesystem.StatStruct)
13-element Vector{Tuple{UInt64, Symbol, Type}}:

```
```
fieldtypes(T::Type)
```

The declared types of all fields in a composite DataType `T` as a tuple.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> fieldtypes(Foo)
(Int64, String)
```
```
filemode(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mode`.
```
filesize(path...)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).size`.
```
fill(value, dims::Tuple)
fill(value, dims...)
```

Create an array of size `dims` with every location set to `value`.

For example, `fill(1.0, (5,5))` returns a 5×5 array of floats, with `1.0` in every location of the array.

The dimension lengths `dims` may be specified as either a tuple or a sequence of arguments. An `N`-length tuple or `N` arguments following the `value` specify an `N`-dimensional array. Thus, a common idiom for creating a zero-dimensional array with its only location set to `x` is `fill(x)`.

Every location of the returned array is set to (and is thus [`===`](@ref) to) the `value` that was passed; this means that if the `value` is itself modified, all elements of the `fill`ed array will reflect that modification because they're *still* that very `value`. This is of no concern with `fill(1.0, (5,5))` as the `value` `1.0` is immutable and cannot itself be modified, but can be unexpected with mutable values like — most commonly — arrays.  For example, `fill([], 3)` places *the very same* empty array in all three locations of the returned vector:

```jldoctest
julia> v = fill([], 3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v[1] === v[2] === v[3]
true

julia> value = v[1]
Any[]

julia> push!(value, 867_5309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
```

To create an array of many independent inner arrays, use a [comprehension](@ref man-comprehensions) instead. This creates a new and distinct array on each iteration of the loop:

```jldoctest
julia> v2 = [[] for _ in 1:3]
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v2[1] === v2[2] === v2[3]
false

julia> push!(v2[1], 8675309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v2
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 []
 []
```

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fill(1.0, (2,3))
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia> fill(42)
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
42

julia> A = fill(zeros(2), 2) # sets both elements to the same [0.0, 0.0] vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [0.0, 0.0]
 [0.0, 0.0]

julia> A[1][1] = 42; # modifies the filled value to be [42.0, 0.0]

julia> A # both A[1] and A[2] are the very same vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [42.0, 0.0]
 [42.0, 0.0]
```
```
fill!(A, x)
```

Fill array `A` with the value `x`. If `x` is an object reference, all elements will refer to the same object. `fill!(A, Foo())` will return `A` filled with the result of evaluating `Foo()` once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,3)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia> fill!(A, 2.)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0

julia> a = [1, 1, 1]; A = fill!(Vector{Vector{Int}}(undef, 3), a); a[1] = 2; A
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [2, 1, 1]
 [2, 1, 1]
 [2, 1, 1]

julia> x = 0; f() = (global x += 1; x); fill!(Vector{Int}(undef, 3), f())
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 1
```
```
filter(f, a)
```

Return a copy of collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Support for `a` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.4.


See also: [`filter!`](@ref), [`Iterators.filter`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:10
1:10

julia> filter(isodd, a)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Return a copy of `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b")
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  2 => "b"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 1 entry:
  1 => "a"
```

```
filter(f, itr::SkipMissing{<:AbstractArray})
```

Return a vector similar to the array wrapped by the given `SkipMissing` iterator but with all missing elements and those for which `f` returns `false` removed.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1 2; missing 4]
2×2 Matrix{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1         2
  missing  4

julia> filter(isodd, skipmissing(x))
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```
```
filter!(f, a)
```

Update collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> filter!(isodd, Vector(1:10))
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter!(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Update `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b", 3=>"c")
Dict{Int64, String} with 3 entries:
  2 => "b"
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter!(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"
```
```
finalize(x)
```

Immediately run finalizers registered for object `x`.
```
finalizer(f, x)
```

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to `x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the behavior of this function is unpredictable.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`. Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or `ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

# Examples

```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing $x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

# Example

```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing $t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```
```
findall(f::Function, A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the indices or keys of `A` where `f(A[I])` returns `true`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

  :C => 0

julia> findall(x -> x >= 0, d)
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :A
 :C

```

```
findall(A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the `true` indices or keys of `A`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
findall(
    pattern::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return a `Vector{UnitRange{Int}}` of all the matches for `pattern` in `string`. Each element of the returned vector is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, like the return value of [`findnext`](@ref).

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

# Examples

findfirst(A)
```

Return the index or key of the first `true` value in `A`. Return `nothing` if no such value is found. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
```
findmax!(rval, rind, A) -> (maxval, index)
```

Find the maximum of `A` and the corresponding linear index along singleton dimensions of `rval` and `rind`, and store the results in `rval` and `rind`. `NaN` is treated as greater than all other values except `missing`.

firstindex(collection) -> Integer
firstindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the first index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the first index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[begin]` and `A[1, begin]` lower to `A[firstindex(A)]` and `A[1, firstindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`first`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref).

```
```
fld(x, y)
```

Largest integer less than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundDown)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fld(7.3,5.5)
1.0

julia> fld.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -2  -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

Because `fld(x, y)` implements strictly correct floored rounding based on the true value of floating-point numbers, unintuitive situations can arise. For example:

```jldoctest
julia> fld(6.0,0.1)
59.0
julia> 6.0/0.1
60.0
julia> 6.0/big(0.1)
59.99999999999999666933092612453056361837965690217069245739573412231113406246995
```

What is happening here is that the true value of the floating-point number written as `0.1` is slightly larger than the numerical value 1/10 while `6.0` represents the number 6 precisely. Therefore the true value of `6.0 / 0.1` is slightly less than 60. When doing division, this is rounded to precisely `60.0`, but `fld(6.0, 0.1)` always takes the floor of the true value, so the result is `59.0`.
```
fld1(x, y)
```

Flooring division, returning a value consistent with `mod1(x,y)`

See also [`mod1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> fld1(x, y)
4

julia> x == fld(x, y) * y + mod(x, y)
true

julia> x == (fld1(x, y) - 1) * y + mod1(x, y)
true
```
```
fldmod(x, y)
```

The floored quotient and modulus after division. A convenience wrapper for `divrem(x, y, RoundDown)`. Equivalent to `(fld(x,y), mod(x,y))`.

See also: [`fld`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).
```
fldmod1(x, y)
```

Return `(fld1(x,y), mod1(x,y))`.

See also [`fld1`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref).
```
flipsign(x, y)
```

Return `x` with its sign flipped if `y` is negative. For example `abs(x) = flipsign(x,x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> flipsign(5, 3)
5

julia> flipsign(5, -3)
-5
```
```
float(x)
```

Convert a number or array to a floating point data type.

See also: [`complex`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`convert`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(1:1000)
1.0:1.0:1000.0

julia> float(typemax(Int32))
2.147483647e9
```

```
float(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type to represent a value of type `T` as a floating point value. Equivalent to `typeof(float(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(Complex{Int})
ComplexF64 (alias for Complex{Float64})

julia> float(Int)
Float64
```
```
floatmax(T = Float64)
```

Return the largest finite number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

See also: [`typemax`](@ref), [`floatmin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmax(Float16)
Float16(6.55e4)

julia> floatmax(Float32)
3.4028235f38

julia> floatmax()
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf
```
```
floatmin(T = Float64)
```

Return the smallest positive normal number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmin(Float16)
Float16(6.104e-5)

julia> floatmin(Float32)
1.1754944f-38

julia> floatmin()
2.2250738585072014e-308
```
```
floor([T,] x)
floor(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
floor(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`floor(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is less than or equal to `x`.

`floor(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
floor(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` down to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> floor(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
30 minutes

julia> floor(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
1 day
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.

```
floor(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` less than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> floor(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> floor(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-06T00:00:00
```
```
flush(stream)
```

Commit all currently buffered writes to the given stream.
```
fma(x, y, z)
```

Computes `x*y+z` without rounding the intermediate result `x*y`. On some systems this is significantly more expensive than `x*y+z`. `fma` is used to improve accuracy in certain algorithms. See [`muladd`](@ref).
```
foldl(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

See also [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`foldr`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldl(=>, 1:4)
((1 => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> foldl(=>, 1:4; init=0)
(((0 => 1) => 2) => 3) => 4

```
```
foldr(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldr(=>, 1:4)
1 => (2 => (3 => 4))

julia> foldr(=>, 1:4; init=0)
1 => (2 => (3 => (4 => 0)))
```
```
foreach(f, c...) -> Nothing
```

Call function `f` on each element of iterable `c`. For multiple iterable arguments, `f` is called elementwise, and iteration stops when any iterator is finished.

`foreach` should be used instead of [`map`](@ref) when the results of `f` are not needed, for example in `foreach(println, array)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri = 1:3:7; res = Int[];

julia> foreach(x -> push!(res, x^2), tri)

julia> res
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1

julia> foreach((x, y) -> println(x, " with ", y), tri, 'a':'z')
1 with a
4 with b
7 with c
```
```
frexp(val)
```

Return `(x,exp)` such that `x` has a magnitude in the interval $[1/2, 1)$ or 0, and `val` is equal to $x \times 2^{exp}$.

(0.8, 4)
```
```

```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a generic `Function` definition.
```
gcd(x, y...)
```

Greatest common (positive) divisor (or zero if all arguments are zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest

julia> gcd(1//3, 2)
1//3

julia> gcd(0, 0, 10, 15)

```
```
gcdx(a, b)
```

Computes the greatest common (positive) divisor of `a` and `b` and their Bézout coefficients, i.e. the integer coefficients `u` and `v` that satisfy $ua+vb = d = gcd(a, b)$. $gcdx(a, b)$ returns $(d, u, v)$.

The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcdx(12, 42)
(6, -3, 1)

julia> gcdx(240, 46)
(2, -9, 47)
```

!!! note
    Bézout coefficients are *not* uniquely defined. `gcdx` returns the minimal Bézout coefficients that are computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. (Ref: D. Knuth, TAoCP, 2/e, p. 325, Algorithm X.) For signed integers, these coefficients `u` and `v` are minimal in the sense that $|u| < |y/d|$ and $|v| < |x/d|$. Furthermore, the signs of `u` and `v` are chosen so that `d` is positive. For unsigned integers, the coefficients `u` and `v` might be near their `typemax`, and the identity then holds only via the unsigned integers' modulo arithmetic.

```
gensym([tag])

get(collection, key, default)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or the given default value if no mapping for the key is present.

```

```
getindex(collection, key...)
```

Retrieve the value(s) stored at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...]` is converted by the compiler to `getindex(a, i, j, ...)`.

See also [`get`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> getindex(A, "a")
1
```

```
getindex(A, inds...)
```

Return a subset of array `A` as specified by `inds`, where each `ind` may be, for example, an `Int`, an [`AbstractRange`](@ref), or a [`Vector`](@ref). See the manual section on [array indexing](@ref man-array-indexing) for details.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> getindex(A, 1)
1

julia> getindex(A, [2, 1])

julia> getindex(A, 2:4)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 2
 4
```

```
getindex(tree::GitTree, target::AbstractString) -> GitObject
```

Look up `target` path in the `tree`, returning a [`GitObject`](@ref) (a [`GitBlob`](@ref) in the case of a file, or another [`GitTree`](@ref) if looking up a directory).

# Examples

```julia
tree = LibGit2.GitTree(repo, "HEAD^{tree}")
readme = tree["README.md"]
subtree = tree["test"]
runtests = subtree["runtests.jl"]
```
```
getkey(collection, key, default)
```

Return the key matching argument `key` if one exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> getkey(D, 'a', 1)
'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> getkey(D, 'd', 'a')
'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```
```
getpid(process) -> Int32
```

Get the child process ID, if it still exists.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


```
getpid() -> Int32
```

Get Julia's process ID.
```
getproperty(value, name::Symbol)
getproperty(value, name::Symbol, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyType
           x
       end

julia> function Base.getproperty(obj::MyType, sym::Symbol)
           if sym === :special
               return obj.x + 1
           else # fallback to getfield
               return getfield(obj, sym)
           end
       end

julia> obj = MyType(1);

julia> obj.special
2

julia> obj.x
1
```

```
gperm(file)
```

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions of the group owning the file.
```
hardlink(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString)
```

Creates a hard link to an existing source file `src` with the name `dst`. The destination, `dst`, must not exist.

See also: [`symlink`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
hasfield(T::Type, name::Symbol)
```

Return a boolean indicating whether `T` has `name` as one of its own fields.

See also [`fieldnames`](@ref), [`fieldcount`](@ref), [`hasproperty`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
            bar::Int
       end

julia> hasfield(Foo, :bar)
true

julia> hasfield(Foo, :x)
false
```
```
hash(x[, h::UInt]) -> UInt
```

Compute an integer hash code such that `isequal(x,y)` implies `hash(x)==hash(y)`. The optional second argument `h` is a hash code to be mixed with the result.

New types should implement the 2-argument form, typically by calling the 2-argument `hash` method recursively in order to mix hashes of the contents with each other (and with `h`). Typically, any type that implements `hash` should also implement its own [`==`](@ref) (hence [`isequal`](@ref)) to guarantee the property mentioned above. Types supporting subtraction (operator `-`) should also implement [`widen`](@ref), which is required to hash values inside heterogeneous arrays.

See also: [`objectid`](@ref), [`Dict`](@ref), [`Set`](@ref).
```
haskey(collection, key) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection has a mapping for a given `key`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> haskey(D, 'a')
true

julia> haskey(D, 'c')
false
```
```
hasmethod(f, t::Type{<:Tuple}[, kwnames]; world=get_world_counter()) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching the given `Tuple` of argument types with the upper bound of world age given by `world`.

If a tuple of keyword argument names `kwnames` is provided, this also checks whether the method of `f` matching `t` has the given keyword argument names. If the matching method accepts a variable number of keyword arguments, e.g. with `kwargs...`, any names given in `kwnames` are considered valid. Otherwise the provided names must be a subset of the method's keyword arguments.

See also [`applicable`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Providing keyword argument names requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> hasmethod(length, Tuple{Array})
true

julia> f(; oranges=0) = oranges;

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:oranges,))
true

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:apples, :bananas))
false

julia> g(; xs...) = 4;

julia> hasmethod(g, Tuple{}, (:a, :b, :c, :d))  # g accepts arbitrary kwargs
true
```
```
hasproperty(x, s::Symbol)
```

Return a boolean indicating whether the object `x` has `s` as one of its own properties.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.2.


See also: [`propertynames`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).
```
hcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 2. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(hcat, x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

```
```
hex2bytes(itr)
```

Given an iterable `itr` of ASCII codes for a sequence of hexadecimal digits, returns a `Vector{UInt8}` of bytes  corresponding to the binary representation: each successive pair of hexadecimal digits in `itr` gives the value of one byte in the return vector.

The length of `itr` must be even, and the returned array has half of the length of `itr`. See also [`hex2bytes!`](@ref) for an in-place version, and [`bytes2hex`](@ref) for the inverse.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `hex2bytes` with iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `hex2bytes`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> hex2bytes(s)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> a = b"01abEF"
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x30
 0x31
 0x61
 0x62
 0x45
 0x46

julia> hex2bytes(a)
3-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0xab
 0xef
```
```
hex2bytes!(dest::AbstractVector{UInt8}, itr)
```

Convert an iterable `itr` of bytes representing a hexadecimal string to its binary representation, similar to [`hex2bytes`](@ref) except that the output is written in-place to `dest`. The length of `dest` must be half the length of `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling hex2bytes! with iterators producing UInt8 requires version 1.7. In earlier versions, you can collect the iterable before calling instead.

```
homedir() -> String
```

Return the current user's home directory.

!!! note
    `homedir` determines the home directory via `libuv`'s `uv_os_homedir`. For details (for example on how to specify the home directory via environment variables), see the [`uv_os_homedir` documentation](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/misc.html#c.uv_os_homedir).

```
htol(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Little-endian.
```
hton(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Network byte order (big-endian).
```
hvcat(rows::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, values...)
```

Horizontal and vertical concatenation in one call. This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument specifies the number of arguments to concatenate in each block row.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c; d e f]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> hvcat((3,3), a,b,c,d,e,f)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> [a b; c d; e f]
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6

julia> hvcat((2,2,2), a,b,c,d,e,f)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6
```

If the first argument is a single integer `n`, then all block rows are assumed to have `n` block columns.
```
hvncat(dim::Int, row_first, values...)
hvncat(dims::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, row_first, values...)
hvncat(shape::Tuple{Vararg{Tuple}}, row_first, values...)
```

Horizontal, vertical, and n-dimensional concatenation of many `values` in one call.

This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument either specifies the shape of the concatenation, similar to `hvcat`, as a tuple of tuples, or the dimensions that specify the key number of elements along each axis, and is used to determine the output dimensions. The `dims` form is more performant, and is used by default when the concatenation operation has the same number of elements along each axis (e.g., [a b; c d;;; e f ; g h]). The `shape` form is used when the number of elements along each axis is unbalanced (e.g., [a b ; c]). Unbalanced syntax needs additional validation overhead. The `dim` form is an optimization for concatenation along just one dimension. `row_first` indicates how `values` are ordered. The meaning of the first and second elements of `shape` are also swapped based on `row_first`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c;;; d e f]
1×3×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  2  3

hypot(x, y)
```

Compute the hypotenuse $\sqrt{|x|^2+|y|^2}$ avoiding overflow and underflow.

This code is an implementation of the algorithm described in: An Improved Algorithm for `hypot(a,b)` by Carlos F. Borges The article is available online at ArXiv at the link   https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09481

```
hypot(x...)
```

Compute the hypotenuse $\sqrt{\sum |x_i|^2}$ avoiding overflow and underflow.

```
identity(x)
```

The identity function. Returns its argument.

See also: [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), and [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg)'s `I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> identity("Well, what did you expect?")
"Well, what did you expect?"
```
```
ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)
```

Return `x` if `condition` is `true`, otherwise return `y`. This differs from `?` or `if` in that it is an ordinary function, so all the arguments are evaluated first. In some cases, using `ifelse` instead of an `if` statement can eliminate the branch in generated code and provide higher performance in tight loops.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ifelse(1 > 2, 1, 2)
2
```
```
ignorestatus(command)
```

Mark a command object so that running it will not throw an error if the result code is non-zero.
```
imag(z)
```

Return the imaginary part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`conj`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag(1 + 3im)
3
```

```
imag(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the imaginary part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `imag.(A)`, except that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 2
 4

julia> imag(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
-1
```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

julia> 4 in a
true

julia> 5 in a
false

julia> missing in [1, 2]

```
include_dependency(path::AbstractString)
```

In a module, declare that the file specified by `path` (relative or absolute) is a dependency for precompilation; that is, the module will need to be recompiled if this file changes.

This is only needed if your module depends on a file that is not used via [`include`](@ref). It has no effect outside of compilation.
```
include_string([mapexpr::Function,] m::Module, code::AbstractString, filename::AbstractString="string")
```

Like [`include`](@ref), except reads code from the given string rather than from a file.

The optional first argument `mapexpr` can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression `expr` in `code`, the `include_string` function actually evaluates `mapexpr(expr)`.  If it is omitted, `mapexpr` defaults to [`identity`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Julia 1.5 is required for passing the `mapexpr` argument.

```
indexin(a, b)
```

Return an array containing the first index in `b` for each value in `a` that is a member of `b`. The output array contains `nothing` wherever `a` is not a member of `b`.

See also: [`sortperm`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'a'];

julia> b = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

julia> indexin(a, b)
6-element Vector{Union{Nothing, Int64}}:

```
```
insert!(a::Vector, index::Integer, item)
```

Insert an `item` into `a` at the given `index`. `index` is the index of `item` in the resulting `a`.

See also: [`push!`](@ref), [`replace`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

 1
 2
  "here"
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
insorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given sorted collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values of the collection according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order, see [`sort`](@ref) for the keywords.

See also [`in`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> insorted(4, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # single match
true

false

julia> insorted(0, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `insorted` was added in Julia 1.6.

```
instances(T::Type)
```

Return a collection of all instances of the given type, if applicable. Mostly used for enumerated types (see `@enum`).

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> @enum Color red blue green

julia> instances(Color)
(red, blue, green)
```
```
intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    As of Julia 1.8 intersect returns a result with the eltype of the type-promoted eltypes of the two inputs


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> intersect([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])
1-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> intersect(Set([1, 2]), BitSet([2, 3]), 1.0:10.0)
Set{Float64} with 1 element:
  2.0
```
```
intersect!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Intersect all passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.
```
inv(x)
```

Return the multiplicative inverse of `x`, such that `x*inv(x)` or `inv(x)*x` yields [`one(x)`](@ref) (the multiplicative identity) up to roundoff errors.

If `x` is a number, this is essentially the same as `one(x)/x`, but for some types `inv(x)` may be slightly more efficient.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> inv(2)
0.5

julia> inv(1 + 2im)
0.2 - 0.4im

julia> inv(1 + 2im) * (1 + 2im)
1.0 + 0.0im

julia> inv(2//3)
3//2
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `inv(::Missing)` requires at least Julia 1.2.

inv(M)
```

Matrix inverse. Computes matrix `N` such that `M * N = I`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Computed by solving the left-division `N = M \ I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> M = [2 5; 1 3]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  5
 1  3

julia> N = inv(M)
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  3.0  -5.0
 -1.0   2.0

julia> M*N == N*M == Matrix(I, 2, 2)
true
```
```
invmod(n, m)
```

Take the inverse of `n` modulo `m`: `y` such that $n y = 1 \pmod m$, and $div(y,m) = 0$. This will throw an error if $m = 0$, or if $gcd(n,m) \neq 1$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> invmod(2, 5)
3

julia> invmod(2, 3)
2

julia> invmod(5, 6)
5
```

Binding `invokelatest` does not exist.
```
invperm(v)
```

Return the inverse permutation of `v`. If `B = A[v]`, then `A == B[invperm(v)]`.

See also [`sortperm`](@ref), [`invpermute!`](@ref), [`isperm`](@ref), [`permutedims`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> p = (2, 3, 1);

julia> invperm(p)
(3, 1, 2)

julia> v = [2; 4; 3; 1];

julia> invperm(v)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 1
 3
 2

julia> A = ['a','b','c','d'];

julia> B = A[v]
4-element Vector{Char}:
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'd': ASCII/Unicode U+0064 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'c': ASCII/Unicode U+0063 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> B[invperm(v)]
4-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'c': ASCII/Unicode U+0063 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'd': ASCII/Unicode U+0064 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```
```
invpermute!(v, p)
```

Like [`permute!`](@ref), but the inverse of the given permutation is applied.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> invpermute!(A, perm);

julia> A
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 1
 3
 1
```
```
isabspath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path is absolute (begins at the root directory).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabspath("/home")
true

julia> isabspath("home")
false
```
```
isabstracttype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as an abstract type (i.e. using the `abstract` keyword).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabstracttype(AbstractArray)
true

julia> isabstracttype(Vector)
false
```
```
isapprox(x, y; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : √eps, nans::Bool=false[, norm::Function])
```

Inexact equality comparison. Two numbers compare equal if their relative distance *or* their absolute distance is within tolerance bounds: `isapprox` returns `true` if `norm(x-y) <= max(atol, rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y)))`. The default `atol` is zero and the default `rtol` depends on the types of `x` and `y`. The keyword argument `nans` determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).

For real or complex floating-point values, if an `atol > 0` is not specified, `rtol` defaults to the square root of [`eps`](@ref) of the type of `x` or `y`, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significant digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an `atol > 0` is supplied, `rtol` defaults to zero.

The `norm` keyword defaults to `abs` for numeric `(x,y)` and to `LinearAlgebra.norm` for arrays (where an alternative `norm` choice is sometimes useful). When `x` and `y` are arrays, if `norm(x-y)` is not finite (i.e. `±Inf` or `NaN`), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of `x` and `y` are approximately equal component-wise.

The binary operator `≈` is equivalent to `isapprox` with the default arguments, and `x ≉ y` is equivalent to `!isapprox(x,y)`.

Note that `x ≈ 0` (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to `x == 0` since the default `atol` is `0`.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate `atol` (or use `norm(x) ≤ atol`) or rearrange your code (e.g. use `x ≈ y` rather than `x - y ≈ 0`).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero `atol` automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the "units") of your problem: for example, in `x - y ≈ 0`, `atol=1e-9` is an absurdly small tolerance if `x` is the [radius of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius) in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if `x` is the [radius of a Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) in meters.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Passing the `norm` keyword argument when comparing numeric (non-array) arguments requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; atol=0.05)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.34)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.33)
false

julia> 0.1 + 1e-10 ≈ 0.1
true

julia> 1e-10 ≈ 0
false

julia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)
true

julia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0]) # using `norm`
true
```

```
isapprox(x; kwargs...) / ≈(x; kwargs...)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using `≈`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y ≈ x`.

The keyword arguments supported here are the same as those in the 2-argument `isapprox`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This method requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
isascii(c::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character belongs to the ASCII character set, or whether this is true for all elements of a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isascii('a')
true

julia> isascii('α')
false

julia> isascii("abc")
true

julia> isascii("αβγ")
false
```

For example, `isascii` can be used as a predicate function for [`filter`](@ref) or [`replace`](@ref) to remove or replace non-ASCII characters, respectively:

```jldoctest
julia> filter(isascii, "abcdeγfgh") # discard non-ASCII chars
"abcdefgh"

julia> replace("abcdeγfgh", !isascii=>' ') # replace non-ASCII chars with spaces
"abcde fgh"
```
```
isassigned(array, i) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given array has a value associated with index `i`. Return `false` if the index is out of bounds, or has an undefined reference.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 5)
true

julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 3 * 3 + 1)
false

julia> mutable struct Foo end

julia> v = similar(rand(3), Foo)
3-element Vector{Foo}:
 #undef
 #undef
 #undef

julia> isassigned(v, 1)
false
```

```
isassigned(ref::RefValue) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given [`Ref`](@ref) is associated with a value. This is always true for a [`Ref`](@ref) of a bitstype object. Return `false` if the reference is undefined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ref = Ref{Function}()
Base.RefValue{Function}(#undef)

julia> isassigned(ref)
false

julia> ref[] = (foobar(x) = x)
foobar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> isassigned(ref)
true

julia> isassigned(Ref{Int}())
true
```
```
isbits(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is an instance of an [`isbitstype`](@ref) type.
```
isbitstype(T)
```

Return `true` if type `T` is a "plain data" type, meaning it is immutable and contains no references to other values, only `primitive` types and other `isbitstype` types. Typical examples are numeric types such as [`UInt8`](@ref), [`Float64`](@ref), and [`Complex{Float64}`](@ref). This category of types is significant since they are valid as type parameters, may not track [`isdefined`](@ref) / [`isassigned`](@ref) status, and have a defined layout that is compatible with C.

See also [`isbits`](@ref), [`isprimitivetype`](@ref), [`ismutable`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isbitstype(Complex{Float64})
true

julia> isbitstype(Complex)
false
```
```
isblockdev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a block device, `false` otherwise.
```
ischardev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a character device, `false` otherwise.
```
iscntrl(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is a control character. Control characters are the non-printing characters of the Latin-1 subset of Unicode.

julia> iscntrl('\x01')
true

julia> iscntrl('a')
false
```
```
isconcretetype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a concrete type, meaning it could have direct instances (values `x` such that `typeof(x) === T`).

See also: [`isbits`](@ref), [`isabstracttype`](@ref), [`issingletontype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isconcretetype(Complex)
false

julia> isconcretetype(Complex{Float32})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex{Float32}})
true

false

julia> isconcretetype(Union{Int,String})
false
```
```

```

Determine whether a global is declared `const` in a given module `m`.

```
isconst(t::DataType, s::Union{Int,Symbol}) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a field `s` is declared `const` in a given type `t`.
```
isdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is a decimal digit (0-9).

# Examples

false

julia> isdigit('9')
true

julia> isdigit('α')
false
```
```
isdir(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a directory, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdir(homedir())
true

false
```

See also [`isfile`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isdirpath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path refers to a directory (for example, ends with a path separator).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdirpath("/home")
false

julia> isdirpath("/home/")
true
```
```
isdisjoint(a, b) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the collections `a` and `b` are disjoint. Equivalent to `isempty(a ∩ b)` but more efficient when possible.

See also: [`intersect`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdisjoint([1, 2], [2, 3, 4])
false

julia> isdisjoint([3, 1], [2, 4])
true
```
```
isdispatchtuple(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a tuple "leaf type", meaning it could appear as a type signature in dispatch and has no subtypes (or supertypes) which could appear in a call.
```
isempty(collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isempty([])
true

julia> isempty([1 2 3])
false
```

```
isempty(condition)
```

Return `true` if no tasks are waiting on the condition, `false` otherwise.
```
isequal(x, y)
```

Similar to [`==`](@ref), except for the treatment of floating point numbers and of missing values. `isequal` treats all floating-point `NaN` values as equal to each other, treats `-0.0` as unequal to `0.0`, and [`missing`](@ref) as equal to `missing`. Always returns a `Bool` value.

`isequal` is an equivalence relation - it is reflexive (`===` implies `isequal`), symmetric (`isequal(a, b)` implies `isequal(b, a)`) and transitive (`isequal(a, b)` and `isequal(b, c)` implies `isequal(a, c)`).

# Implementation

The default implementation of `isequal` calls `==`, so a type that does not involve floating-point values generally only needs to define `==`.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that types for which a custom `==` or `isequal` method exists must implement a corresponding [`hash`](@ref) method (and vice versa). Collections typically implement `isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

Furthermore, `isequal` is linked with [`isless`](@ref), and they work together to define a fixed total ordering, where exactly one of `isequal(x, y)`, `isless(x, y)`, or `isless(y, x)` must be `true` (and the other two `false`).

Scalar types generally do not need to implement `isequal` separate from `==`, unless they represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient implementation than that provided as a generic fallback (based on `isnan`, `signbit`, and `==`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isequal([1., NaN], [1., NaN])
true

julia> [1., NaN] == [1., NaN]
false

julia> 0.0 == -0.0
true

julia> isequal(0.0, -0.0)
false

julia> missing == missing
missing

julia> isequal(missing, missing)
true
```

```
isequal(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`isequal`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> isequal(y, x)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(isequal)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
```
iseven(x::Number) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `x` is an even integer (that is, an integer divisible by 2), and `false` otherwise.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Non-`Integer` arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iseven(9)
false

julia> iseven(10)
true
```
```
isfifo(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a FIFO, `false` otherwise.
```
isfile(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a regular file, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfile(homedir())
false

julia> f = open("test_file.txt", "w");

julia> isfile(f)
true

julia> close(f); rm("test_file.txt")
```

See also [`isdir`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isfinite(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is finite.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfinite(5)
true

julia> isfinite(NaN32)
false
```
```
isimmutable(v) -> Bool
```

!!! warning
    Consider using `!ismutable(v)` instead, as `isimmutable(v)` will be replaced by `!ismutable(v)` in a future release. (Since Julia 1.5)


Return `true` iff value `v` is immutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isimmutable(1)
true

julia> isimmutable([1,2])
false
```
```
isinf(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is infinite.

See also: [`Inf`](@ref), [`iszero`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).
```
isinteger(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` is numerically equal to some integer.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isinteger(4.0)
true
```
```
isinteractive() -> Bool
```

Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.
```
isless(t1::Tuple, t2::Tuple)
```

Returns true when t1 is less than t2 in lexicographic order.

```
isless(x, y)
```

Test whether `x` is less than `y`, according to a fixed total order (defined together with [`isequal`](@ref)). `isless` is not defined on all pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, if it is defined, it is expected to satisfy the following:

  * If `isless(x, y)` is defined, then so is `isless(y, x)` and `isequal(x, y)`, and exactly one of those three yields `true`.
  * The relation defined by `isless` is transitive, i.e., `isless(x, y) && isless(y, z)` implies `isless(x, z)`.

Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`, are ordered after regular values. [`missing`](@ref) values are ordered last.

This is the default comparison used by [`sort`](@ref).

# Implementation

Non-numeric types with a total order should implement this function. Numeric types only need to implement it if they have special values such as `NaN`. Types with a partial order should implement [`<`](@ref). See the documentation on [Alternate orderings](@ref) for how to define alternate ordering methods that can be used in sorting and related functions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless(1, 3)
true

julia> isless("Red", "Blue")
false
```

```
isless(A::AbstractVector, B::AbstractVector)
```

Returns true when `A` is less than `B` in lexicographic order.

```
isless(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether string `a` comes before string `b` in alphabetical order (technically, in lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless("a", "b")
true

julia> isless("β", "α")
false

julia> isless("a", "a")
false
```
```
isletter(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

false

julia> isletter('α')
true

julia> isletter('9')
false
```
```
islink(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a symbolic link, `false` otherwise.
```
islocked(lock) -> Status (Boolean)
```

Check whether the `lock` is held by any task/thread. This should not be used for synchronization (see instead [`trylock`](@ref)).
```
islowercase(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is a lowercase letter (according to the Unicode standard's `Lowercase` derived property).

See also [`isuppercase`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> islowercase('α')
true

julia> islowercase('Γ')
false

julia> islowercase('❤')
false
```
```
ismarked(s::IO)
```

Return `true` if stream `s` is marked.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`unmark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref).
```

See also: [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`isnothing`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).
```
ismount(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a mount point, `false` otherwise.
```
ismutable(v) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if and only if value `v` is mutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

```

Tests whether a character is numeric. A character is classified as numeric if it belongs to the Unicode general category Number, i.e. a character whose category code begins with 'N'.

Note that this broad category includes characters such as ¾ and ௰. Use [`isdigit`](@ref) to check whether a character a decimal digit between 0 and 9.

```
isone(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == one(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether `x` is an identity matrix.

true
```
```
isopen(object) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an object - such as a stream or timer – is not yet closed. Once an object is closed, it will never produce a new event. However, since a closed stream may still have data to read in its buffer, use [`eof`](@ref) to check for the ability to read data. Use the `FileWatching` package to be notified when a stream might be writable or readable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("my_file.txt", "w+");

julia> isopen(io)
true

julia> close(io)

julia> isopen(io)
false
```
```
ispath(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if a valid filesystem entity exists at `path`, otherwise returns `false`. This is the generalization of [`isfile`](@ref), [`isdir`](@ref) etc.
```
isperm(v) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `v` is a valid permutation.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isperm([1; 2])
true

julia> isperm([1; 3])
false
```
```
ispow2(n::Number) -> Bool
```

Test whether `n` is an integer power of two.

```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as a primitive type (i.e. using the `primitive` keyword).
```
isprint(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is printable, including spaces, but not a control character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isprint('\x01')
false

julia> isprint('A')
true
```
```
ispunct(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character belongs to the Unicode general category Punctuation, i.e. a character whose category code begins with 'P'.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ispunct('α')
false

julia> ispunct('/')
true

julia> ispunct(';')
true
```
```
isqrt(n::Integer)
```

Integer square root: the largest integer `m` such that `m*m <= n`.

```jldoctest
julia> isqrt(5)
2
```
```
isreadable(io) -> Bool
```

Return `false` if the specified IO object is not readable.

       end
true

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isreadonly(io) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a stream is read-only.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> isreadonly(io)
true

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> isreadonly(io)
false
```
```
isready(c::Channel)
```

Determine whether a [`Channel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Returns immediately, does not block.

For unbuffered channels returns `true` if there are tasks waiting on a [`put!`](@ref).

```
isready(rr::Future)
```

Determine whether a [`Future`](@ref) has a value stored to it.

If the argument `Future` is owned by a different node, this call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for `rr` in a separate task instead or to use a local [`Channel`](@ref) as a proxy:

```julia
p = 1
f = Future(p)
errormonitor(@async put!(f, remotecall_fetch(long_computation, p)))
isready(f)  # will not block
```

```
isready(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Determine whether a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Note that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may no longer be true. However, it can be safely used on a [`Future`](@ref) since they are assigned only once.
```
isreal(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` or all its elements are numerically equal to some real number including infinities and NaNs. `isreal(x)` is true if `isequal(x, real(x))` is true.

Return `true` if `path` is a socket, `false` otherwise.
```
issorted(v, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Test whether a vector is in sorted order. The `lt`, `by` and `rev` keywords modify what order is considered to be sorted just as they do for [`sort`](@ref).

julia> issorted([1, 2, 3])
true

julia> issorted([(1, "b"), (2, "a")], by = x -> x[1])
true

julia> issorted([(1, "b"), (2, "a")], by = x -> x[2])

true
```
```
isspace(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is any whitespace character. Includes ASCII characters '\t', '\n', '\v', '\f', '\r', and ' ', Latin-1 character U+0085, and characters in Unicode category Zs.

```

Return `true` if `path` has the sticky bit set, `false` otherwise.
```
isstructtype(T) -> Bool
```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as a struct type (i.e. using the `struct` or `mutable struct` keyword).
```
issubnormal(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a floating point number is subnormal.
```
issubset(a, b) -> Bool
⊆(a, b) -> Bool
⊇(b, a) -> Bool
```

Determine whether every element of `a` is also in `b`, using [`in`](@ref).

See also [`⊊`](@ref), [`⊈`](@ref), [`∩`](@ref intersect), [`∪`](@ref union), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> issubset([1, 2], [1, 2, 3])
true

julia> [1, 2, 3] ⊆ [1, 2]
false

julia> [1, 2, 3] ⊇ [1, 2]
true
```
```
istaskdone(t::Task) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a task has exited.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a2() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a2);

julia> istaskdone(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
istaskfailed(t::Task) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a task has exited because an exception was thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a4() = error("task failed");

julia> b = Task(a4);

julia> istaskfailed(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskfailed(b)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
istaskstarted(t::Task) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a task has started executing.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a3() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a3);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false
```
```
istextmime(m::MIME)
```

Determine whether a MIME type is text data. MIME types are assumed to be binary data except for a set of types known to be text data (possibly Unicode).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> istextmime(MIME("text/plain"))
true

julia> istextmime(MIME("image/png"))
false
```
```
isunordered(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is a value that is not orderable according to [`<`](@ref), such as `NaN` or `missing`.

The values that evaluate to `true` with this predicate may be orderable with respect to other orderings such as [`isless`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
isuppercase(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is an uppercase letter (according to the Unicode standard's `Uppercase` derived property).

See also [`islowercase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isuppercase('γ')
false

julia> isuppercase('Γ')
true

julia> isuppercase('❤')
false
```
```
isvalid(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Bool
```

Predicate indicating whether the given index is the start of the encoding of a character in `s` or not. If `isvalid(s, i)` is true then `s[i]` will return the character whose encoding starts at that index, if it's false, then `s[i]` will raise an invalid index error or a bounds error depending on if `i` is in bounds. In order for `isvalid(s, i)` to be an O(1) function, the encoding of `s` must be [self-synchronizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code). This is a basic assumption of Julia's generic string support.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`iterate`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref), [`length`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγdef";

julia> isvalid(str, 1)
true

julia> str[1]
'α': Unicode U+03B1 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> isvalid(str, 2)
false

julia> str[2]
ERROR: StringIndexError: invalid index [2], valid nearby indices [1]=>'α', [3]=>'β'
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
isvalid(value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for its type, which currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String` or `SubString{String}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char(0xd800))
false

julia> isvalid(SubString(String(UInt8[0xfe,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80]),1,2))
false

julia> isvalid(Char(0xd799))
true
```

```
isvalid(T, value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for that type. Types currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String`. Values for `AbstractChar` can be of type `AbstractChar` or [`UInt32`](@ref). Values for `String` can be of that type, `SubString{String}`, `Vector{UInt8}`, or a contiguous subarray thereof.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd800)
false

julia> isvalid(String, SubString("thisisvalid",1,5))
true

julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd799)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Support for subarray values was added in Julia 1.6.

```
iswritable(io) -> Bool
```

Return `false` if the specified IO object is not writable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           print(io, "Hello world!");
           iswritable(io)
       end
true

julia> open("myfile.txt", "r") do io
           iswritable(io)
       end
false

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isxdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character is a valid hexadecimal digit. Note that this does not include `x` (as in the standard `0x` prefix).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isxdigit('a')
true

julia> isxdigit('x')
false
```
```
iszero(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == zero(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether all of the elements of `x` are zero.

See also: [`isone`](@ref), [`isinteger`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iszero(0.0)
true

julia> iszero([1, 9, 0])
false

julia> iszero([false, 0, 0])
true
```
```
iterate(iter [, state]) -> Union{Nothing, Tuple{Any, Any}}
```

Advance the iterator to obtain the next element. If no elements remain, `nothing` should be returned. Otherwise, a 2-tuple of the next element and the new iteration state should be returned.

```
iterate(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{Tuple{<:AbstractChar, Int}, Nothing}
```

Return a tuple of the character in `s` at index `i` with the index of the start of the following character in `s`. This is the key method that allows strings to be iterated, yielding a sequences of characters. If `i` is out of bounds in `s` then a bounds error is raised. The `iterate` function, as part of the iteration protocol may assume that `i` is the start of a character in `s`.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
join([io::IO,] iterator [, delim [, last]])
```

Join any `iterator` into a single string, inserting the given delimiter (if any) between adjacent items.  If `last` is given, it will be used instead of `delim` between the last two items.  Each item of `iterator` is converted to a string via `print(io::IOBuffer, x)`. If `io` is given, the result is written to `io` rather than returned as a `String`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> join(["apples", "bananas", "pineapples"], ", ", " and ")
"apples, bananas and pineapples"

julia> join([1,2,3,4,5])
"12345"
```
```
joinpath(parts::AbstractString...) -> String
joinpath(parts::Vector{AbstractString}) -> String
joinpath(parts::Tuple{AbstractString}) -> String
```

Join path components into a full path. If some argument is an absolute path or (on Windows) has a drive specification that doesn't match the drive computed for the join of the preceding paths, then prior components are dropped.

Note on Windows since there is a current directory for each drive, `joinpath("c:", "foo")` represents a path relative to the current directory on drive "c:" so this is equal to "c:foo", not "c:\foo". Furthermore, `joinpath` treats this as a non-absolute path and ignores the drive letter casing, hence `joinpath("C:\A","c:b") = "C:\A\b"`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath("/home/myuser", "example.jl")
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath(["/home/myuser", "example.jl"])
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```
```
keepat!(a::Vector, inds)
keepat!(a::BitVector, inds)
```

Remove the items at all the indices which are not given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Items which are kept are shifted to fill the resulting gaps.

`inds` must be an iterator of sorted and unique integer indices. See also [`deleteat!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keepat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 2
```

```
keepat!(a::Vector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
keepat!(a::BitVector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
```

The in-place version of logical indexing `a = a[m]`. That is, `keepat!(a, m)` on vectors of equal length `a` and `m` will remove all elements from `a` for which `m` at the corresponding index is `false`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [:a, :b, :c];

julia> keepat!(a, [true, false, true])
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c

julia> a
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c
```
```
keys(a::AbstractArray)
```

Return an efficient array describing all valid indices for `a` arranged in the shape of `a` itself.

They keys of 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) are integers, whereas all other N-dimensional arrays use [`CartesianIndex`](@ref) to describe their locations.  Often the special array types [`LinearIndices`](@ref) and [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) are used to efficiently represent these arrays of integers and `CartesianIndex`es, respectively.

Note that the `keys` of an array might not be the most efficient index type; for maximum performance use  [`eachindex`](@ref) instead.

```
keys(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values (e.g. arrays and dictionaries), return an iterator over the keys.

```
keys(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all keys in a dictionary. `collect(keys(a))` returns an array of keys. When the keys are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(keys(D))
2-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

```
keys(m::RegexMatch) -> Vector
```

Return a vector of keys for all capture groups of the underlying regex. A key is included even if the capture group fails to match. That is, `idx` will be in the return value even if `m[idx] == nothing`.

Unnamed capture groups will have integer keys corresponding to their index. Named capture groups will have string keys.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method was added in Julia 1.6


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keys(match(r"(?<hour>\d+):(?<minute>\d+)(am|pm)?", "11:30"))
3-element Vector{Any}:
  "hour"
  "minute"
 3
```
```
keytype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
keytype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the key type of an array. This is equal to the `eltype` of the result of `keys(...)`, and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype([1, 2, 3]) == Int
true

julia> keytype([1 2; 3 4])
CartesianIndex{2}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
keytype(type)
```

Get the key type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
Int32
```
```
kill(p::Process, signum=Base.SIGTERM)
```

Send a signal to a process. The default is to terminate the process. Returns successfully if the process has already exited, but throws an error if killing the process failed for other reasons (e.g. insufficient permissions).

```
kill(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)
```

Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, by [`rmprocs`](@ref). It should cause the remote worker specified by `pid` to exit. `kill(manager::ClusterManager.....)` executes a remote `exit()` on `pid`.
```
kron(A, B)
```

Kronecker tensor product of two vectors or two matrices.

For real vectors `v` and `w`, the Kronecker product is related to the outer product by `kron(v,w) == vec(w * transpose(v))` or `w * transpose(v) == reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))`. Note how the ordering of `v` and `w` differs on the left and right of these expressions (due to column-major storage). For complex vectors, the outer product `w * v'` also differs by conjugation of `v`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> B = [im 1; 1 -im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im
 1+0im  0-1im

julia> kron(A, B)
4×4 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im  0+2im  2+0im
 1+0im  0-1im  2+0im  0-2im
 0+3im  3+0im  0+4im  4+0im
 3+0im  0-3im  4+0im  0-4im

julia> v = [1, 2]; w = [3, 4, 5];

julia> w*transpose(v)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10

julia> reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10
```
```
kron!(C, A, B)
```

`kron!` is the in-place version of [`kron`](@ref). Computes `kron(A, B)` and stores the result in `C` overwriting the existing value of `C`.

!!! tip
    Bounds checking can be disabled by [`@inbounds`](@ref), but you need to take care of the shape of `C`, `A`, `B` yourself.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
last(coll)
```

Get the last element of an ordered collection, if it can be computed in O(1) time. This is accomplished by calling [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last index. Return the end point of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) even if it is empty.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`endswith`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(1:2:10)
9

julia> last([1; 2; 3; 4])
4
```

```
last(itr, n::Integer)
```

Get the last `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(["foo", "bar", "qux"], 2)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "bar"
 "qux"

julia> last(1:6, 10)
1:6

julia> last(Float64[], 1)
Float64[]
```

```
last(s::AbstractString, n::Integer)
```

Get a string consisting of the last `n` characters of `s`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 0)
""

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 1)
"0"

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 3)
"²>0"
```
```
lastindex(collection) -> Integer
lastindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the last index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the last index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[end]` and `A[end, end]` lower to `A[lastindex(A)]` and `A[lastindex(A, 1), lastindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`axes`](@ref), [`firstindex`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lastindex([1,2,4])
3

julia> lastindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
4
```
```
lcm(x, y...)
```

Least common (positive) multiple (or zero if any argument is zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lcm(2, 3)

```
ldexp(x, n)
```

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ldexp(5., 2)
20.0
```
```
leading_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_ones(UInt32(2 ^ 32 - 2))
31
```
```
leading_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_zeros(Int32(1))
31
```
```
length(collection) -> Integer
```

Return the number of elements in the collection.

Use [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last valid index of an indexable collection.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length(1:5)
5

julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the number of elements in the array, defaults to `prod(size(A))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(s::AbstractString) -> Int
length(s::AbstractString, i::Integer, j::Integer) -> Int
```

Return the number of characters in string `s` from indices `i` through `j`.

This is computed as the number of code unit indices from `i` to `j` which are valid character indices. With only a single string argument, this computes the number of characters in the entire string. With `i` and `j` arguments it computes the number of indices between `i` and `j` inclusive that are valid indices in the string `s`. In addition to in-bounds values, `i` may take the out-of-bounds value `ncodeunits(s) + 1` and `j` may take the out-of-bounds value `0`.

!!! note
    The time complexity of this operation is linear in general. That is, it will take the time proportional to the number of bytes or characters in the string because it counts the value on the fly. This is in contrast to the method for arrays, which is a constant-time operation.


See also [`isvalid`](@ref), [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length("jμΛIα")
5
```
```
lock(lock)
```

Acquire the `lock` when it becomes available. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

Each `lock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).

```
lock(f::Function, lock)
```

Acquire the `lock`, execute `f` with the `lock` held, and release the `lock` when `f` returns. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

When this function returns, the `lock` has been released, so the caller should not attempt to `unlock` it.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a [`Channel`](@ref) as the second argument requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
log(b,x)
```

Compute the base `b` logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(4,8)
1.5

julia> log(4,2)
0.5

julia> log(-2, 3)

```

!!! note
    If `b` is a power of 2 or 10, [`log2`](@ref) or [`log10`](@ref) should be used, as these will typically be faster and more accurate. For example,

    ```jldoctest

log(x)
```

Compute the natural logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments to obtain complex results.

See also [`log1p`], [`log2`], [`log10`].

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"

log(A::StridedMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of `A`, i.e. the unique matrix $X$ such that $e^X = A$ and $-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi$ for all the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $X$. If `A` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, if `A` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [^AH12] and [^AHR13]). If `A` is real with no negative eigenvalues, then the real Schur form is computed. Otherwise, the complex Schur form is computed. Then the upper (quasi-)triangular algorithm in [^AHR13] is used on the upper (quasi-)triangular factor.

```
log10(x)
```

Compute the logarithm of `x` to base 10. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log10(100)
2.0

julia> log10(2)
0.3010299956639812

```
log1p(x)
```

Accurate natural logarithm of `1+x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for [`Real`](@ref) arguments less than -1.

# Examples

```
lowercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to lowercase.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`lowercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercase("STRINGS AND THINGS")
"strings and things"
```
```
lowercasefirst(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to lowercase.

See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercasefirst("Julia")
"julia"
```
```
lpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the left with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lpad("March", 10)
"     March"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
lstat(file)
```

Like [`stat`](@ref), but for symbolic links gets the info for the link itself rather than the file it refers to. This function must be called on a file path rather than a file object or a file descriptor.
```
lstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
lstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = lpad("March", 20)
"               March"

julia> lstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
ltoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Little-endian to that used by the Host.
```
macroexpand(m::Module, x; recursive=true)
```

Take the expression `x` and return an equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded) for executing in module `m`. The `recursive` keyword controls whether deeper levels of nested macros are also expanded. This is demonstrated in the example below:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m1()
               42
           end
           macro m2()
               :(@m1())
           end
       end
M

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=true)
42

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=false)
:(#= REPL[16]:6 =# M.@m1)
```
```
map(f, c...) -> collection
```

Transform collection `c` by applying `f` to each element. For multiple collection arguments, apply `f` elementwise, and stop when when any of them is exhausted.

See also [`map!`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`mapreduce`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`Iterators.map`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> map(x -> x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 4
 6

julia> map(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 400, 5000])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 11
 22
 33
```

```
map(f, A::AbstractArray...) -> N-array
```

When acting on multi-dimensional arrays of the same [`ndims`](@ref), they must all have the same [`axes`](@ref), and the answer will too.

See also [`broadcast`](@ref), which allows mismatched sizes.

# Examples

```
julia> map(//, [1 2; 3 4], [4 3; 2 1])
2×2 Matrix{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//4  2//3
 3//2  4//1

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], zeros(2,1))
ERROR: DimensionMismatch

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], [1,10,100,1000], zeros(3,1))  # iterates until 3rd is exhausted
3-element Vector{Float64}:
   2.0
  13.0
 102.0
```
```
map!(function, destination, collection...)
```

Like [`map`](@ref), but stores the result in `destination` rather than a new collection. `destination` must be at least as large as the smallest collection.

See also: [`map`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`copyto!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = zeros(3);

julia> map!(x -> x * 2, a, [1, 2, 3]);

julia> a
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 2.0
 4.0
 6.0

julia> map!(+, zeros(Int, 5), 100:999, 1:3)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 101
 103
 105
   0
   0
```

```
map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))
```

Modifies `dict` by transforming each value from `val` to `f(val)`. Note that the type of `dict` cannot be changed: if `f(val)` is not an instance of the value type of `dict` then it will be converted to the value type if possible and otherwise raise an error.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))` requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2)
Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries:
  :a => 1
  :b => 2

julia> map!(v -> v-1, values(d))
ValueIterator for a Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  0
  1
```
```
mapfoldl(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity, as in [`foldl`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapfoldr(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity, as in [`foldr`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapreduce(f, op, itrs...; [init])
```

Apply function `f` to each element(s) in `itrs`, and then reduce the result using the binary function `op`. If provided, `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

[`mapreduce`](@ref) is functionally equivalent to calling `reduce(op, map(f, itr); init=init)`, but will in general execute faster since no intermediate collection needs to be created. See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref) and [`map`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mapreduce(x->x^2, +, [1:3;]) # == 1 + 4 + 9
14
```

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent. Additionally, some implementations may reuse the return value of `f` for elements that appear multiple times in `itr`. Use [`mapfoldl`](@ref) or [`mapfoldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity and invocation of `f` for every value.

```
mapreduce(f, op, A::AbstractArray...; dims=:, [init])
```

Evaluates to the same as `reduce(op, map(f, A...); dims=dims, init=init)`, but is generally faster because the intermediate array is avoided.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> mapreduce(isodd, *, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Bool}:
 0  0  0  0

julia> mapreduce(isodd, |, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  1  1  1
```
```
mapslices(f, A; dims)
```

Transform the given dimensions of array `A` using function `f`. `f` is called on each slice of `A` of the form `A[...,:,...,:,...]`. `dims` is an integer vector specifying where the colons go in this expression. The results are concatenated along the remaining dimensions. For example, if `dims` is `[1,2]` and `A` is 4-dimensional, `f` is called on `A[:,:,i,j]` for all `i` and `j`.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16),(2,2,2,2))

```
```
mark(s::IO)
```

Add a mark at the current position of stream `s`. Return the marked position.

See also [`unmark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
match(r::Regex, s::AbstractString[, idx::Integer[, addopts]])
```

Search for the first match of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return a [`RegexMatch`](@ref) object containing the match, or nothing if the match failed. The matching substring can be retrieved by accessing `m.match` and the captured sequences can be retrieved by accessing `m.captures` The optional `idx` argument specifies an index at which to start the search.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a(.)a"
r"a(.)a"

julia> m = match(rx, "cabac")
RegexMatch("aba", 1="b")

julia> m.captures
1-element Vector{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}}}:
 "b"

julia> m.match
"aba"

julia> match(rx, "cabac", 3) === nothing
true
```
```
max(x, y, ...)
```

Return the maximum of the arguments (with respect to [`isless`](@ref)). See also the [`maximum`](@ref) function to take the maximum element from a collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> max(2, 5, 1)
5
```
```
maximum(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest result of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> maximum(length, ["Julion", "Julia", "Jule"])
6

julia> maximum(length, []; init=-1)
-1

julia> maximum(sin, Real[]; init=-1.0)  # good, since output of sin is >= -1
-1.0
```

```
maximum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest element in a collection.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"

```

```
maximum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`max(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the maximum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `max.(a,b)`.

See also: [`maximum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmax`](@ref), [`argmax`](@ref).

# Examples

 3  4

julia> maximum(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 4
```

```
maximum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> maximum(abs2, A, dims=1)

 9  16

julia> maximum(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:

```
```
maximum!(r, A)
```

Compute the maximum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

julia> maximum!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  4
```
```
maxintfloat(T=Float64)
```

The largest consecutive integer-valued floating-point number that is exactly represented in the given floating-point type `T` (which defaults to `Float64`).

That is, `maxintfloat` returns the smallest positive integer-valued floating-point number `n` such that `n+1` is *not* exactly representable in the type `T`.

When an `Integer`-type value is needed, use `Integer(maxintfloat(T))`.

```
maxintfloat(T, S)
```

The largest consecutive integer representable in the given floating-point type `T` that also does not exceed the maximum integer representable by the integer type `S`.  Equivalently, it is the minimum of `maxintfloat(T)` and [`typemax(S)`](@ref).
```
merge(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. If the same key is present in another collection, the value for that key will be the value it has in the last collection listed. See also [`mergewith`](@ref) for custom handling of values with the same key.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict("foo" => 0.0, "bar" => 42.0)
Dict{String, Float64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> b = Dict("baz" => 17, "bar" => 4711)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 4711
  "baz" => 17

julia> merge(a, b)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 4711.0

julia> merge(b, a)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, bs::NamedTuple...)
```

Construct a new named tuple by merging two or more existing ones, in a left-associative manner. Merging proceeds left-to-right, between pairs of named tuples, and so the order of fields present in both the leftmost and rightmost named tuples take the same position as they are found in the leftmost named tuple. However, values are taken from matching fields in the rightmost named tuple that contains that field. Fields present in only the rightmost named tuple of a pair are appended at the end. A fallback is implemented for when only a single named tuple is supplied, with signature `merge(a::NamedTuple)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Merging 3 or more `NamedTuple` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), (b=4, d=5))
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2), (b=3, c=(d=1,)), (c=(d=2,),))
(a = 1, b = 3, c = (d = 2,))
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, iterable)
```

Interpret an iterable of key-value pairs as a named tuple, and perform a merge.

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), [:b=>4, :d=>5])
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```
```
merge!(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. See also [`merge`](@ref).

# Examples

```
```
mergewith(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
mergewith(combine)
merge(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
mergewith!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
mergewith!(combine)
merge!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith!(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith!(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge!(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith!(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
methods(f, [types], [module])
```

Return the method table for `f`.

If `types` is specified, return an array of methods whose types match. If `module` is specified, return an array of methods defined in that module. A list of modules can also be specified as an array.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"

Compute the minimum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`min(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the minimum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `min.(a,b)`.

See also: [`minimum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmin`](@ref), [`argmin`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> minimum(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

julia> minimum(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 1
 3
```

```
minimum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> minimum(abs2, A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  4

julia> minimum(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 1
 9
```
```
minimum!(r, A)
```

Compute the minimum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> minimum!([1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3

julia> minimum!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
```
```
minmax(x, y)
```

Return `(min(x,y), max(x,y))`.

See also [`extrema`](@ref) that returns `(minimum(x), maximum(x))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> minmax('c','b')
('b', 'c')
```
```
mkdir(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Make a new directory with name `path` and permissions `mode`. `mode` defaults to `0o777`, modified by the current file creation mask. This function never creates more than one directory. If the directory already exists, or some intermediate directories do not exist, this function throws an error. See [`mkpath`](@ref) for a function which creates all required intermediate directories. Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> mkdir("testingdir")
"testingdir"

julia> cd("testingdir")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/testingdir"
```
```
mkpath(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Create all intermediate directories in the `path` as required. Directories are created with the permissions `mode` which defaults to `0o777` and is modified by the current file creation mask. Unlike [`mkdir`](@ref), `mkpath` does not error if `path` (or parts of it) already exists. However, an error will be thrown if `path` (or parts of it) points to an existing file. Return `path`.

If `path` includes a filename you will probably want to use `mkpath(dirname(path))` to avoid creating a directory using the filename.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd(mktempdir())

julia> mkpath("my/test/dir") # creates three directories
"my/test/dir"

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "my"

julia> cd("my")

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "test"

julia> readdir("test")
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "dir"

julia> mkpath("intermediate_dir/actually_a_directory.txt") # creates two directories
"intermediate_dir/actually_a_directory.txt"

julia> isdir("intermediate_dir/actually_a_directory.txt")
true

```
```
mktemp(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> (path, io)
```

Return `(path, io)`, where `path` is the path of a new temporary file in `parent` and `io` is an open file object for this path. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary file is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktemp` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


```
mktemp(f::Function, parent=tempdir())
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktemp(parent)`](@ref) and remove the temporary file upon completion.

See also: [`mktempdir`](@ref).
```
mktempdir(parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_", cleanup=true) -> path
```

Create a temporary directory in the `parent` directory with a name constructed from the given prefix and a random suffix, and return its path. Additionally, any trailing `X` characters may be replaced with random characters. If `parent` does not exist, throw an error. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary directory is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.


!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktempdir` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.

```
mktempdir(f::Function, parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_")
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktempdir(parent; prefix)`](@ref) and remove the temporary directory all of its contents upon completion.

See also: [`mktemp`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"

```
mod(x::Integer, r::AbstractUnitRange)
```

Find `y` in the range `r` such that $x ≡ y (mod n)$, where `n = length(r)`, i.e. `y = mod(x - first(r), n) + first(r)`.

See also [`mod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod(0, Base.OneTo(3))  # mod1(0, 3)
3

julia> mod(3, 0:2)  # mod(3, 3)
0
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


```
mod(x, y)
rem(x, y, RoundDown)
```

The reduction of `x` modulo `y`, or equivalently, the remainder of `x` after floored division by `y`, i.e. `x - y*fld(x,y)` if computed without intermediate rounding.

The result will have the same sign as `y`, and magnitude less than `abs(y)` (with some exceptions, see note below).

!!! note
    When used with floating point values, the exact result may not be representable by the type, and so rounding error may occur. In particular, if the exact result is very close to `y`, then it may be rounded to `y`.

```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```
```
mod1(x, y)
```

Modulus after flooring division, returning a value `r` such that `mod(r, y) == mod(x, y)` in the range $(0, y]$ for positive `y` and in the range $[y,0)$ for negative `y`.

With integer arguments and positive `y`, this is equal to `mod(x, 1:y)`, and hence natural for 1-based indexing. By comparison, `mod(x, y) == mod(x, 0:y-1)` is natural for computations with offsets or strides.

See also [`mod`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod1(4, 2)
2

julia> mod1.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:

 2.9  3.0  0.1  1.0  2.0  2.9  3.0  0.1
```
```
mod2pi(x)
```

Modulus after division by `2π`, returning in the range $[0,2π)$.

This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact `2π`, and is therefore not exactly the same as `mod(x,2π)`, which would compute the modulus of `x` relative to division by the floating-point number `2π`.

!!! note
    Depending on the format of the input value, the closest representable value to 2π may be less than 2π. For example, the expression `mod2pi(2π)` will not return `0`, because the intermediate value of `2*π` is a `Float64` and `2*Float64(π) < 2*big(π)`. See [`rem2pi`](@ref) for more refined control of this behavior.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod2pi(9*pi/4)
0.7853981633974481
```
```
modf(x)
```

Return a tuple `(fpart, ipart)` of the fractional and integral parts of a number. Both parts have the same sign as the argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> modf(3.5)
(0.5, 3.0)

julia> modf(-3.5)
(-0.5, -3.0)
```
```
modifyproperty!(x, f::Symbol, op, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic! max(a().b, c)` returns `modifyproperty!(a(), :b, max, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where the first argument must be a `getfield` expression and is modified atomically.

See also [`modifyfield!`](@ref Core.modifyfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
mtime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mtime`.
```
muladd(x, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add: computes `x*y+z`, but allowing the add and multiply to be merged with each other or with surrounding operations for performance. For example, this may be implemented as an [`fma`](@ref) if the hardware supports it efficiently. The result can be different on different machines and can also be different on the same machine due to constant propagation or other optimizations. See [`fma`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> muladd(3, 2, 1)
7

julia> 3 * 2 + 1
7
```

```
muladd(A, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add, `A*y .+ z`, for matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. The result is always the same size as `A*y`, but `z` may be smaller, or a scalar.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    These methods require Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest

```
```
mv(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false)
```

Move the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`. Return `dst`.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> write("hello.txt", "world");

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
"goodbye.txt"

julia> "hello.txt" in readdir()
false

julia> readline("goodbye.txt")

nameof(m::Module) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a `Module` as a [`Symbol`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nameof(Base.Broadcast)
:Broadcast
```

```
nameof(t::DataType) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType` (without its parent module) as a symbol.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct S{T}
           end
       end
Foo

julia> nameof(Foo.S{T} where T)
:S
```

```
nameof(f::Function) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a generic `Function` as a symbol. For anonymous functions, this is a compiler-generated name. For explicitly-declared subtypes of `Function`, it is the name of the function's type.
```
names(x::Module; all::Bool = false, imported::Bool = false)
```

Get an array of the names exported by a `Module`, excluding deprecated names. If `all` is true, then the list also includes non-exported names defined in the module, deprecated names, and compiler-generated names. If `imported` is true, then names explicitly imported from other modules are also included.

As a special case, all names defined in `Main` are considered "exported", since it is not idiomatic to explicitly export names from `Main`.

```
nand(x, y)
⊼(x, y)
```

Bitwise nand (not and) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊼ b` is a synonym for `nand(a,b)`, and `⊼` can be typed by tab-completing `\nand` or `\barwedge` in the Julia REPL.

ncodeunits(c::Char) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units required to encode a character as UTF-8. This is the number of bytes which will be printed if the character is written to an output stream, or `ncodeunits(string(c))` but computed efficiently.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 consider using `ncodeunits(string(c))`.


```
ncodeunits(s::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units in a string. Indices that are in bounds to access this string must satisfy `1 ≤ i ≤ ncodeunits(s)`. Not all such indices are valid – they may not be the start of a character, but they will return a code unit value when calling `codeunit(s,i)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ncodeunits("The Julia Language")
18

julia> ncodeunits("∫eˣ")
6

julia> ncodeunits('∫'), ncodeunits('e'), ncodeunits('ˣ')
(3, 1, 2)
```

```
ndigits(n::Integer; base::Integer=10, pad::Integer=1)
```

Compute the number of digits in integer `n` written in base `base` (`base` must not be in `[-1, 0, 1]`), optionally padded with zeros to a specified size (the result will never be less than `pad`).

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `nextfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`prevfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the smallest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `x < y`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.

See also: [`prevfloat`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref).
```
nextind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts after index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the next character; if `i` is not the start of a character, move forward until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `0` return `1`. If `i` is in bounds but greater or equal to `lastindex(str)` return `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `nextind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `nextind` would reach `ncodeunits(str)+1` then each remaining iteration increases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `nextind` can return a value greater than `ncodeunits(str)+1`.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `s` or is equal to `0`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextind("α", 0)

nor(x, y)
⊽(x, y)
```

Bitwise nor (not or) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊽ b` is a synonym for `nor(a,b)`, and `⊽` can be typed by tab-completing `\nor` or `\barvee` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

"/home/example.jl"

julia> normpath("Documents/Julia") == joinpath("Documents", "Julia")
true
```

```
normpath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to a normalized path by joining them together and removing "." and ".." entries. Equivalent to `normpath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)
```

Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them `val`. If `all` is `true` (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If `error` is `true`, the passed value is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

Return the count of tasks woken up. Return 0 if no tasks are waiting on `condition`.
```
ntoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Network byte order (big-endian) to that used by the Host.
```
ntuple(f::Function, n::Integer)
```

Create a tuple of length `n`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, 4)
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```
ntuple(f, ::Val{N})
```

Create a tuple of length `N`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element. By taking a `Val(N)` argument, it is possible that this version of ntuple may generate more efficient code than the version taking the length as an integer. But `ntuple(f, N)` is preferable to `ntuple(f, Val(N))` in cases where `N` cannot be determined at compile time.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, Val(4))
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```
```
numerator(x)

```
objectid(x) -> UInt
```

Get a hash value for `x` based on object identity. `objectid(x)==objectid(y)` if `x === y`.

See also [`hash`](@ref), [`IdDict`](@ref).
```
occursin(needle::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern,AbstractChar}, haystack::AbstractString)
```

Determine whether the first argument is a substring of the second. If `needle` is a regular expression, checks whether `haystack` contains a match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> occursin("Julia", "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin('a', "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "aba")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "abba")
false
```

See also [`contains`](@ref).

```
occursin(haystack)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument occurs in `haystack`, i.e. a function equivalent to `needle -> occursin(needle, haystack)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(occursin)}`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
oftype(x, y)
```

Convert `y` to the type of `x` (`convert(typeof(x), y)`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 4;

julia> y = 3.;

julia> oftype(x, y)
3

julia> oftype(y, x)
4.0
```
```
one(x)
one(T::type)
```

Return a multiplicative identity for `x`: a value such that `one(x)*x == x*one(x) == x`.  Alternatively `one(T)` can take a type `T`, in which case `one` returns a multiplicative identity for any `x` of type `T`.

If possible, `one(x)` returns a value of the same type as `x`, and `one(T)` returns a value of type `T`.  However, this may not be the case for types representing dimensionful quantities (e.g. time in days), since the multiplicative identity must be dimensionless.  In that case, `one(x)` should return an identity value of the same precision (and shape, for matrices) as `x`.

If you want a quantity that is of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`, even if `x` is dimensionful, use [`oneunit`](@ref) instead.

See also the [`identity`](@ref) function, and `I` in [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg) for the identity matrix.

Returns `T(one(x))`, where `T` is either the type of the argument or (if a type is passed) the argument.  This differs from [`one`](@ref) for dimensionful quantities: `one` is dimensionless (a multiplicative identity) while `oneunit` is dimensionful (of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> oneunit(3.7)
1.0

julia> import Dates; oneunit(Dates.Day)
1 day
```
```
only(x)
```

Return the one and only element of collection `x`, or throw an [`ArgumentError`](@ref) if the collection has zero or multiple elements.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`last`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.4.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> only(["a"])
"a"

julia> only("a")
'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> only(())

```
```
open(f::Function, args...; kwargs...)
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of `open(args...; kwargs...)` and close the resulting file descriptor upon completion.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "Hello world!")
       end;

julia> open(f->read(f, String), "myfile.txt")
"Hello world!"

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```

```
open(filename::AbstractString; lock = true, keywords...) -> IOStream
```

Open a file in a mode specified by five boolean keyword arguments:

| Keyword    | Description            | Default                               |
|:---------- |:---------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| `read`     | open for reading       | `!write`                              |
| `write`    | open for writing       | `truncate \| append`                  |
| `create`   | create if non-existent | `!read & write \| truncate \| append` |
| `truncate` | truncate to zero size  | `!read & write`                       |
| `append`   | seek to end            | `false`                               |

The default when no keywords are passed is to open files for reading only. Returns a stream for accessing the opened file.

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(filename::AbstractString, [mode::AbstractString]; lock = true) -> IOStream
```

Alternate syntax for open, where a string-based mode specifier is used instead of the five booleans. The values of `mode` correspond to those from `fopen(3)` or Perl `open`, and are equivalent to setting the following boolean groups:

| Mode | Description                   | Keywords                       |
|:---- |:----------------------------- |:------------------------------ |
| `r`  | read                          | none                           |
| `w`  | write, create, truncate       | `write = true`                 |
| `a`  | write, create, append         | `append = true`                |
| `r+` | read, write                   | `read = true, write = true`    |
| `w+` | read, write, create, truncate | `truncate = true, read = true` |
| `a+` | read, write, create, append   | `append = true, read = true`   |

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "w");

julia> write(io, "Hello world!");

julia> close(io);

julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "r");

julia> read(io, String)
"Hello world!"

julia> write(io, "This file is read only")
ERROR: ArgumentError: write failed, IOStream is not writeable
[...]

julia> close(io)

julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "a");

julia> write(io, "This stream is not read only")
28

julia> close(io)

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(fd::OS_HANDLE) -> IO
```

Take a raw file descriptor wrap it in a Julia-aware IO type, and take ownership of the fd handle. Call `open(Libc.dup(fd))` to avoid the ownership capture of the original handle.

!!! warning
    Do not call this on a handle that's already owned by some other part of the system.


```
open(command, mode::AbstractString, stdio=devnull)
```

Run `command` asynchronously. Like `open(command, stdio; read, write)` except specifying the read and write flags via a mode string instead of keyword arguments. Possible mode strings are:

| Mode | Description | Keywords                    |
|:---- |:----------- |:--------------------------- |
| `r`  | read        | none                        |
| `w`  | write       | `write = true`              |
| `r+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |
| `w+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |

```
open(command, stdio=devnull; write::Bool = false, read::Bool = !write)
```

Start running `command` asynchronously, and return a `process::IO` object.  If `read` is true, then reads from the process come from the process's standard output and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard input stream.  If `write` is true, then writes go to the process's standard input and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard output stream. The process's standard error stream is connected to the current global `stderr`.

```
open(f::Function, command, args...; kwargs...)
```

Similar to `open(command, args...; kwargs...)`, but calls `f(stream)` on the resulting process stream, then closes the input stream and waits for the process to complete. Return the value returned by `f` on success. Throw an error if the process failed, or if the process attempts to print anything to stdout.
```
operm(file)
```

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions for people who neither own the file nor are a member of the group owning the file
```
pairs(collection)
```

Return an iterator over `key => value` pairs for any collection that maps a set of keys to a set of values. This includes arrays, where the keys are the array indices.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict(zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]))
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> pairs(a)
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> foreach(println, pairs(["a", "b", "c"]))
1 => "a"
2 => "b"
3 => "c"

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> pairs |> collect
3-element Vector{Pair{Symbol, Int64}}:
 :a => 1
 :b => 2
 :c => 3

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> collect
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
pairs(IndexLinear(), A)
pairs(IndexCartesian(), A)
pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
```

An iterator that accesses each element of the array `A`, returning `i => x`, where `i` is the index for the element and `x = A[i]`. Identical to `pairs(A)`, except that the style of index can be selected. Also similar to `enumerate(A)`, except `i` will be a valid index for `A`, while `enumerate` always counts from 1 regardless of the indices of `A`.

Specifying [`IndexLinear()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be an integer; specifying [`IndexCartesian()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be a [`CartesianIndex`](@ref); specifying `IndexStyle(A)` chooses whichever has been defined as the native indexing style for array `A`.

Mutation of the bounds of the underlying array will invalidate this iterator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = ["a" "d"; "b" "e"; "c" "f"];

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
4 d
5 e
6 f

julia> S = view(A, 1:2, :);

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(S), S)
           println("$index $value")
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1) a
CartesianIndex(2, 1) b
CartesianIndex(1, 2) d
CartesianIndex(2, 2) e
```

See also [`IndexStyle`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref).
```
parent(A)
```

Return the underlying "parent array”. This parent array of objects of types `SubArray`, `ReshapedArray` or `LinearAlgebra.Transpose` is what was passed as an argument to `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, etc. during object creation. If the input is not a wrapped object, return the input itself. If the input is wrapped multiple times, only the outermost wrapper will be removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> V = view(A, 1:2, :)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1:2, :) with eltype Int64:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(V)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
parentindices(A)
```

Return the indices in the [`parent`](@ref) which correspond to the array view `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> V = view(A, 1, :)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1, :) with eltype Int64:
 1
 2

julia> parentindices(V)
(1, Base.Slice(Base.OneTo(2)))
```
```
parentmodule(m::Module) -> Module
```

Get a module's enclosing `Module`. `Main` is its own parent.

See also: [`names`](@ref), [`nameof`](@ref), [`fullname`](@ref), [`@__MODULE__`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parentmodule(Main)
Main

julia> parentmodule(Base.Broadcast)
Base
```

```
parentmodule(t::DataType) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the definition of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct Int end
       end
Foo

julia> parentmodule(Int)
Core

julia> parentmodule(Foo.Int)
Foo
```

```
parentmodule(f::Function) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the (first) definition of a generic function.

```
parentmodule(f::Function, types) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing a given definition of a generic function.
```
parse(type, str; base)
```

Parse a string as a number. For `Integer` types, a base can be specified (the default is 10). For floating-point types, the string is parsed as a decimal floating-point number.  `Complex` types are parsed from decimal strings of the form `"R±Iim"` as a `Complex(R,I)` of the requested type; `"i"` or `"j"` can also be used instead of `"im"`, and `"R"` or `"Iim"` are also permitted. If the string does not contain a valid number, an error is raised.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `parse(Bool, str)` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse(Int, "1234")
1234

julia> parse(Int, "1234", base = 5)
194

julia> parse(Int, "afc", base = 16)
2812

julia> parse(Float64, "1.2e-3")
0.0012

julia> parse(Complex{Float64}, "3.2e-1 + 4.5im")
0.32 + 4.5im
```

```
parse(::Type{Platform}, triplet::AbstractString)
```

Parses a string platform triplet back into a `Platform` object.
```
partialsort(v, k, by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Variant of [`partialsort!`](@ref) which copies `v` before partially sorting it, thereby returning the same thing as `partialsort!` but leaving `v` unmodified.
```
partialsort!(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Partially sort the vector `v` in place, according to the order specified by `by`, `lt` and `rev` so that the value at index `k` (or range of adjacent values if `k` is a range) occurs at the position where it would appear if the array were fully sorted via a non-stable algorithm. If `k` is a single index, that value is returned; if `k` is a range, an array of values at those indices is returned. Note that `partialsort!` does not fully sort the input array.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4)
4

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 4

julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4, rev=true)
2

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
partialsortperm(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return a partial permutation `I` of the vector `v`, so that `v[I]` returns values of a fully sorted version of `v` at index `k`. If `k` is a range, a vector of indices is returned; if `k` is an integer, a single index is returned. The order is specified using the same keywords as `sort!`. The permutation is stable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

Note that this function is equivalent to, but more efficient than, calling `sortperm(...)[k]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> v[partialsortperm(v, 1)]
1

julia> p = partialsortperm(v, 1:3)
3-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 1:3) with eltype Int64:
 2
 4
 3

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
```
```
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false, initialized=false)
```

Like [`partialsortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix` the same size as `v`, which is used to store (a permutation of) the indices of `v`.

If the index vector `ix` is initialized with the indices of `v` (or a permutation thereof), `initialized` should be set to `true`.

If `initialized` is `false` (the default), then `ix` is initialized to contain the indices of `v`.

If `initialized` is `true`, but `ix` does not contain (a permutation of) the indices of `v`, the behavior of `partialsortperm!` is undefined.

(Typically, the indices of `v` will be `1:length(v)`, although if `v` has an alternative array type with non-one-based indices, such as an `OffsetArray`, `ix` must also be an `OffsetArray` with the same indices, and must contain as values (a permutation of) these same indices.)

Upon return, `ix` is guaranteed to have the indices `k` in their sorted positions, such that

```julia
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k);
v[ix[k]] == partialsort(v, k)
```

The return value is the `k`th element of `ix` if `k` is an integer, or view into `ix` if `k` is a range.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> ix = Vector{Int}(undef, 4);

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 1)
2

julia> ix = [1:4;];

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 2:3, initialized=true)
2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 2:3) with eltype Int64:
 4
 3
```

```

```
```
pathof(m::Module)
```

Return the path of the `m.jl` file that was used to `import` module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package.

Use [`dirname`](@ref) to get the directory part and [`basename`](@ref) to get the file name part of the path.
```
peek(stream[, T=UInt8])
```

Read and return a value of type `T` from a stream without advancing the current position in the stream.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = IOBuffer("julia");

julia> peek(b)
0x6a

julia> position(b)
0

julia> peek(b, Char)
'j': ASCII/Unicode U+006A (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The method which accepts a type requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
permute!(v, p)
```

Permute vector `v` in-place, according to permutation `p`. No checking is done to verify that `p` is a permutation.

To return a new permutation, use `v[p]`. Note that this is generally faster than `permute!(v,p)` for large vectors.

See also [`invpermute!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> permute!(A, perm);

julia> A
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 3
 1
```

```
permute!(X::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         p::AbstractVector{<:Integer}, q::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         [C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

Bilaterally permute `A`, storing result `PAQ` (`A[p,q]`) in `X`. Stores intermediate result `(AQ)^T` (`transpose(A[:,q])`) in optional argument `C` if present. Requires that none of `X`, `A`, and, if present, `C` alias each other; to store result `PAQ` back into `A`, use the following method lacking `X`:

```
permute!(A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, p::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         q::AbstractVector{<:Integer}[, C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         [workcolptr::Vector{Ti}]]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

`X`'s dimensions must match those of `A` (`size(X, 1) == size(A, 1)` and `size(X, 2) == size(A, 2)`), and `X` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(X)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(X)) >= nnz(A)`). Column-permutation `q`'s length must match `A`'s column count (`length(q) == size(A, 2)`). Row-permutation `p`'s length must match `A`'s row count (`length(p) == size(A, 1)`).

`C`'s dimensions must match those of `transpose(A)` (`size(C, 1) == size(A, 2)` and `size(C, 2) == size(A, 1)`), and `C` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(C)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(C)) >= nnz(A)`).

For additional (algorithmic) information, and for versions of these methods that forgo argument checking, see (unexported) parent methods `unchecked_noalias_permute!` and `unchecked_aliasing_permute!`.

See also [`permute`](@ref).
```
permutedims(A::AbstractArray, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `A`. `perm` is a vector or a tuple of length `ndims(A)` specifying the permutation.

See also [`permutedims!`](@ref), [`PermutedDimsArray`](@ref), [`transpose`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

julia> perm = [4,1,3,2];

julia> size(permutedims(B, perm))
(13, 5, 11, 7)

julia> size(B)[perm] == ans
true
```

```
permutedims(m::AbstractMatrix)
```

Permute the dimensions of the matrix `m`, by flipping the elements across the diagonal of the matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> b = [5 6; 7 8];

julia> c = [9 10; 11 12];

julia> d = [13 14; 15 16];

julia> X = [[a] [b]; [c] [d]]

julia> permutedims(X)
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [9 10; 11 12]
 [5 6; 7 8]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> transpose(X)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:

 [5 7; 6 8]  [13 15; 14 16]
```

```
permutedims(v::AbstractVector)
```

Reshape vector `v` into a `1 × length(v)` row matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> permutedims([1, 2, 3, 4])
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4

julia> V = [[[1 2; 3 4]]; [[5 6; 7 8]]]
2-element Vector{Matrix{Int64}}:

julia> transpose(V)
1×2 transpose(::Vector{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [5 7; 6 8]
```
```
permutedims!(dest, src, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `src` and store the result in the array `dest`. `perm` is a vector specifying a permutation of length `ndims(src)`. The preallocated array `dest` should have `size(dest) == size(src)[perm]` and is completely overwritten. No in-place permutation is supported and unexpected results will happen if `src` and `dest` have overlapping memory regions.

See also [`permutedims`](@ref).
```
pipeline(command; stdin, stdout, stderr, append=false)
```

Redirect I/O to or from the given `command`. Keyword arguments specify which of the command's streams should be redirected. `append` controls whether file output appends to the file. This is a more general version of the 2-argument `pipeline` function. `pipeline(from, to)` is equivalent to `pipeline(from, stdout=to)` when `from` is a command, and to `pipeline(to, stdin=from)` when `from` is another kind of data source.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`dothings`, stdout="out.txt", stderr="errs.txt"))
run(pipeline(`update`, stdout="log.txt", append=true))
```

```
pipeline(from, to, ...)
```

Create a pipeline from a data source to a destination. The source and destination can be commands, I/O streams, strings, or results of other `pipeline` calls. At least one argument must be a command. Strings refer to filenames. When called with more than two arguments, they are chained together from left to right. For example, `pipeline(a,b,c)` is equivalent to `pipeline(pipeline(a,b),c)`. This provides a more concise way to specify multi-stage pipelines.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`ls`, `grep xyz`))
run(pipeline(`ls`, "out.txt"))
run(pipeline("out.txt", `grep xyz`))
```
```
pkgdir(m::Module[, paths::String...])
```

Return the root directory of the package that imported module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package. Optionally further path component strings can be provided to construct a path within the package root.

```julia-repl
julia> pkgdir(Foo)
"/path/to/Foo.jl"

julia> pkgdir(Foo, "src", "file.jl")
"/path/to/Foo.jl/src/file.jl"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"

```
pointer(array [, index])
```

Get the native address of an array or string, optionally at a given location `index`.

This function is "unsafe". Be careful to ensure that a Julia reference to `array` exists as long as this pointer will be used. The [`GC.@preserve`](@ref) macro should be used to protect the `array` argument from garbage collection within a given block of code.

Calling [`Ref(array[, index])`](@ref Ref) is generally preferable to this function as it guarantees validity.
```
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

Get the memory address of a Julia object as a `Ptr`. The existence of the resulting `Ptr` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the `Ptr` will be used.

This function may not be called on immutable objects, since they do not have stable memory addresses.

See also [`unsafe_pointer_to_objref`](@ref).

Remove an item in `collection` and return it. If `collection` is an ordered container, the last item is returned; for unordered containers, an arbitrary element is returned.

See also: [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), and [`push!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A=[1, 2, 3]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

2

julia> S
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  1

julia> pop!(Dict(1=>2))
1 => 2
```

```
pop!(collection, key[, default])
```

Delete and return the mapping for `key` if it exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>3);

julia> pop!(d, "a")
1

julia> pop!(d, "d")
ERROR: KeyError: key "d" not found
Stacktrace:
[...]

julia> pop!(d, "e", 4)
4
```
```
popat!(a::Vector, i::Integer, [default])
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return it. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap. When `i` is not a valid index for `a`, return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

See also: [`pop!`](@ref), [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

Pop the topmost backend off of the display-backend stack, or the topmost copy of `d` in the second variant.
```
popfirst!(collection) -> item
```

Remove the first `item` from `collection`.

This function is called `shift` in many other programming languages.

```
precision(num::AbstractFloat; base::Integer=2)
precision(T::Type; base::Integer=2)
```

Get the precision of a floating point number, as defined by the effective number of bits in the significand, or the precision of a floating-point type `T` (its current default, if `T` is a variable-precision type like [`BigFloat`](@ref)).

If `base` is specified, then it returns the maximum corresponding number of significand digits in that base.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
precompile(f, args::Tuple{Vararg{Any}})
```

Compile the given function `f` for the argument tuple (of types) `args`, but do not execute it.
```
prepend!(a::Vector, collections...) -> collection
```

Insert the elements of each `collections` to the beginning of `a`.

When `collections` specifies multiple collections, order is maintained: elements of `collections[1]` will appear leftmost in `a`, and so on.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Specifying multiple collections to be prepended requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prepend!([3], [1, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> prepend!([6], [1, 2], [3, 4, 5])

```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `prevfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`nextfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the largest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `y < x`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `-Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.
```
prevind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts before index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the previous character; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `1` return `0`. If `i` is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1` return `lastindex(str)`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `prevind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `prevind` would reach `0` then each remaining iteration decreases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `prevind` can return a negative value.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `str` or is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevind("α", 3)
1

julia> prevind("α", 1)
0

julia> prevind("α", 0)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [0]
[...]

julia> prevind("α", 2, 2)
0

julia> prevind("α", 2, 3)
-1
```
```
prevpow(a, x)
```

The largest `a^n` not greater than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must not be less than 1.

See also [`nextpow`](@ref), [`isqrt`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevpow(2, 7)

julia> prevpow(2, 9)
8

julia> prevpow(5, 20)
5

julia> prevpow(4, 16)

```
```
print([io::IO], xs...)
```

Write to `io` (or to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref) if `io` is not given) a canonical (un-decorated) text representation. The representation used by `print` includes minimal formatting and tries to avoid Julia-specific details.

`print` falls back to calling `show`, so most types should just define `show`. Define `print` if your type has a separate "plain" representation. For example, `show` displays strings with quotes, and `print` displays strings without quotes.

See also [`println`](@ref), [`string`](@ref), [`printstyled`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> print(io, "Hello", ' ', :World!)

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello World!"
```
```
println([io::IO], xs...)
```

Print (using [`print`](@ref)) `xs` to `io` followed by a newline. If `io` is not supplied, prints to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref).

See also [`printstyled`](@ref) to add colors etc.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println("Hello, world")
Hello, world

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> println(io, "Hello", ',', " world.")

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello, world.\n"
```
```
printstyled([io], xs...; bold::Bool=false, underline::Bool=false, blink::Bool=false, reverse::Bool=false, hidden::Bool=false, color::Union{Symbol,Int}=:normal)
```

Print `xs` in a color specified as a symbol or integer, optionally in bold.

Keyword `color` may take any of the values `:normal`, `:default`, `:bold`, `:black`, `:blink`, `:blue`, `:cyan`, `:green`, `:hidden`, `:light_black`, `:light_blue`, `:light_cyan`, `:light_green`, `:light_magenta`, `:light_red`, `:light_white`, `:light_yellow`, `:magenta`, `:nothing`, `:red`, `:reverse`, `:underline`, `:white`, or  `:yellow` or an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive. Note that not all terminals support 256 colors.

Keywords `bold=true`, `underline=true`, `blink=true` are self-explanatory. Keyword `reverse=true` prints with foreground and background colors exchanged, and `hidden=true` should be invisibe in the terminal but can still be copied. These properties can be used in any combination.

See also [`print`](@ref), [`println`](@ref), [`show`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Keywords except `color` and `bold` were added in Julia 1.7.

```
process_exited(p::Process)
```

Determine whether a process has exited.
```
process_running(p::Process)
```

Determine whether a process is currently running.
```
prod(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of `f` applied to each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prod(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
576
```

```
prod(itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of all elements of a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.

julia> prod(1:5; init = 1.0)
120.0
```

```
prod(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply elements of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8

julia> prod(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  2
 12
```

```
prod(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply the results of calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=1)

 9  64

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
   4
 144
```
```
prod!(r, A)
```

Multiply elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod!([1; 1], A)

  2
 12

julia> prod!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8
```
```
promote(xs...)
```

Convert all arguments to a common type, and return them all (as a tuple). If no arguments can be converted, an error is raised.

See also: [`promote_type`], [`promote_rule`].

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote(Int8(1), Float16(4.5), Float32(4.1))
(1.0f0, 4.5f0, 4.1f0)
```
```
promote_rule(type1, type2)
```

Specifies what type should be used by [`promote`](@ref) when given values of types `type1` and `type2`. This function should not be called directly, but should have definitions added to it for new types as appropriate.
```
promote_shape(s1, s2)
```

Check two array shapes for compatibility, allowing trailing singleton dimensions, and return whichever shape has more dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = fill(1, (3,4,1,1,1));

julia> b = fill(1, (3,4));

julia> promote_shape(a,b)
(Base.OneTo(3), Base.OneTo(4), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1))

julia> promote_shape((2,3,1,4), (2, 3, 1, 4, 1))
(2, 3, 1, 4, 1)
```
```
promote_type(type1, type2)
```

Promotion refers to converting values of mixed types to a single common type. `promote_type` represents the default promotion behavior in Julia when operators (usually mathematical) are given arguments of differing types. `promote_type` generally tries to return a type which can at least approximate most values of either input type without excessively widening.  Some loss is tolerated; for example, `promote_type(Int64, Float64)` returns [`Float64`](@ref) even though strictly, not all [`Int64`](@ref) values can be represented exactly as `Float64` values.

See also: [`promote`](@ref), [`promote_typejoin`](@ref), [`promote_rule`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote_type(Int64, Float64)
Float64

julia> promote_type(Int32, Int64)
Int64

julia> promote_type(Float32, BigInt)
BigFloat

julia> promote_type(Int16, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int64, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int8, UInt16)
UInt16
```

!!! warning "Don't overload this directly"
    To overload promotion for your own types you should overload [`promote_rule`](@ref). `promote_type` calls `promote_rule` internally to determine the type. Overloading `promote_type` directly can cause ambiguity errors.

```
propertynames(x, private=false)
```

Get a tuple or a vector of the properties (`x.property`) of an object `x`. This is typically the same as [`fieldnames(typeof(x))`](@ref), but types that overload [`getproperty`](@ref) should generally overload `propertynames` as well to get the properties of an instance of the type.

`propertynames(x)` may return only "public" property names that are part of the documented interface of `x`.   If you want it to also return "private" fieldnames intended for internal use, pass `true` for the optional second argument. REPL tab completion on `x.` shows only the `private=false` properties.

See also: [`hasproperty`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).
```
push!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` in `collection`. If `collection` is an ordered container, the items are inserted at the end (in the given order).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> push!([1, 2, 3], 4, 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```

If `collection` is ordered, use [`append!`](@ref) to add all the elements of another collection to it. The result of the preceding example is equivalent to `append!([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`. For `AbstractSet` objects, [`union!`](@ref) can be used instead.

See [`sizehint!`](@ref) for notes about the performance model.

See also [`pushfirst!`](@ref).
```
pushdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pushes a new display `d` on top of the global display-backend stack. Calling `display(x)` or `display(mime, x)` will display `x` on the topmost compatible backend in the stack (i.e., the topmost backend that does not throw a [`MethodError`](@ref)).
```
pushfirst!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` at the beginning of `collection`.

This function is called `unshift` in many other programming languages.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> pushfirst!([1, 2, 3, 4], 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 1
 2
 3
 4
```
```
put!(c::Channel, v)
```

Append an item `v` to the channel `c`. Blocks if the channel is full.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`take!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `v` now gets converted to the channel's type with [`convert`](@ref) as `put!` is called.


```
put!(rr::Future, v)
```

Store a value to a [`Future`](@ref) `rr`. `Future`s are write-once remote references. A `put!` on an already set `Future` throws an `Exception`. All asynchronous remote calls return `Future`s and set the value to the return value of the call upon completion.

```
put!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Store a set of values to the [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). If the channel is full, blocks until space is available. Return the first argument.
```
pwd() -> AbstractString
```

Get the current working directory.

See also: [`cd`](@ref), [`tempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"
```
```
rad2deg(x)
```

Convert `x` from radians to degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rad2deg(pi)
180.0
```
```
rand([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [S], [dims...])
```

Pick a random element or array of random elements from the set of values specified by `S`; `S` can be

  * an indexable collection (for example `1:9` or `('x', "y", :z)`),
  * an `AbstractDict` or `AbstractSet` object,
  * a string (considered as a collection of characters), or
  * a type: the set of values to pick from is then equivalent to `typemin(S):typemax(S)` for integers (this is not applicable to [`BigInt`](@ref)), to $[0, 1)$ for floating point numbers and to $[0, 1)+i[0, 1)$ for complex floating point numbers;

`S` defaults to [`Float64`](@ref). When only one argument is passed besides the optional `rng` and is a `Tuple`, it is interpreted as a collection of values (`S`) and not as `dims`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Support for `S` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Int, 2)

 0.696556  0.783855   0.938235
```

!!! note
    The complexity of `rand(rng, s::Union{AbstractDict,AbstractSet})` is linear in the length of `s`, unless an optimized method with constant complexity is available, which is the case for `Dict`, `Set` and dense `BitSet`s. For more than a few calls, use `rand(rng, collect(s))` instead, or either `rand(rng, Dict(s))` or `rand(rng, Set(s))` as appropriate.

```
randn([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [T=Float64], [dims...])
```

Generate a normally-distributed random number of type `T` with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Optionally generate an array of normally-distributed random numbers. The `Base` module currently provides an implementation for the types [`Float16`](@ref), [`Float32`](@ref), and [`Float64`](@ref) (the default), and their [`Complex`](@ref) counterparts. When the type argument is complex, the values are drawn from the circularly symmetric complex normal distribution of variance 1 (corresponding to real and imaginary part having independent normal distribution with mean zero and variance `1/2`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using Random

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234);

julia> randn(rng, ComplexF64)

```
```
range(start, stop, length)
range(start, stop; length, step)
range(start; length, stop, step)
range(;start, length, stop, step)
```

Construct a specialized array with evenly spaced elements and optimized storage (an [`AbstractRange`](@ref)) from the arguments. Mathematically a range is uniquely determined by any three of `start`, `step`, `stop` and `length`. Valid invocations of range are:

  * Call `range` with any three of `start`, `step`, `stop`, `length`.
  * Call `range` with two of `start`, `stop`, `length`. In this case `step` will be assumed to be one. If both arguments are Integers, a [`UnitRange`](@ref) will be returned.
  * Call `range` with one of `stop` or `length`. `start` and `step` will be assumed to be one.

See Extended Help for additional details on the returned type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, length=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, stop=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, step=5, length=100)
1:5:496

julia> range(1, step=5, stop=100)
1:5:96

julia> range(1, 10, length=101)
1.0:0.09:10.0

julia> range(1, 100, step=5)
1:5:96

julia> range(stop=10, length=5)
6:10

julia> range(stop=10, step=1, length=5)
6:1:10

julia> range(start=1, step=1, stop=10)
1:1:10

julia> range(; length = 10)
Base.OneTo(10)

julia> range(; stop = 6)
Base.OneTo(6)

julia> range(; stop = 6.5)
1.0:1.0:6.0
```

If `length` is not specified and `stop - start` is not an integer multiple of `step`, a range that ends before `stop` will be produced.

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, 3.5, step=2)
1.0:2.0:3.0
```

Special care is taken to ensure intermediate values are computed rationally. To avoid this induced overhead, see the [`LinRange`](@ref) constructor.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `stop` as a positional argument requires at least Julia 1.1.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The versions without keyword arguments and `start` as a keyword argument require at least Julia 1.7.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The versions with `stop` as a sole keyword argument, or `length` as a sole keyword argument require at least Julia 1.8.


# Extended Help

```
rationalize([T<:Integer=Int,] x; tol::Real=eps(x))
```

Approximate floating point number `x` as a [`Rational`](@ref) number with components of the given integer type. The result will differ from `x` by no more than `tol`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

103//10

julia> typeof(numerator(a))
BigInt

```
read(io::IO, T)
```

Read a single value of type `T` from `io`, in canonical binary representation.

Note that Julia does not convert the endianness for you. Use [`ntoh`](@ref) or [`ltoh`](@ref) for this purpose.

```
read(io::IO, String)
```

Read the entirety of `io`, as a `String` (see also [`readchomp`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, String)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization"
```

```
read(filename::AbstractString, args...)
```

Open a file and read its contents. `args` is passed to `read`: this is equivalent to `open(io->read(io, args...), filename)`.

```
read(filename::AbstractString, String)
```

Read the entire contents of a file as a string.

```
read(s::IO, nb=typemax(Int))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

```
read(s::IOStream, nb::Integer; all=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.

```
read(command::Cmd)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as an array of bytes.

```
read(command::Cmd, String)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as a `String`.
```
read!(stream::IO, array::AbstractArray)
read!(filename::AbstractString, array::AbstractArray)
```

Read binary data from an I/O stream or file, filling in `array`.
```
readavailable(stream)
```

Read available buffered data from a stream. Actual I/O is performed only if no data has already been buffered. The result is a `Vector{UInt8}`.

!!! warning
    The amount of data returned is implementation-dependent; for example it can depend on the internal choice of buffer size. Other functions such as [`read`](@ref) should generally be used instead.

```
readbytes!(stream::IO, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

```
readbytes!(stream::IOStream, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b); all::Bool=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.
```
readchomp(x)
```

Read the entirety of `x` as a string and remove a single trailing newline if there is one. Equivalent to `chomp(read(x, String))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> readchomp("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members."

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```
```
readdir(dir::AbstractString=pwd();
    join::Bool = false,
    sort::Bool = true,
) -> Vector{String}
```

Return the names in the directory `dir` or the current working directory if not given. When `join` is false, `readdir` returns just the names in the directory as is; when `join` is true, it returns `joinpath(dir, name)` for each `name` so that the returned strings are full paths. If you want to get absolute paths back, call `readdir` with an absolute directory path and `join` set to true.

By default, `readdir` sorts the list of names it returns. If you want to skip sorting the names and get them in the order that the file system lists them, you can use `readdir(dir, sort=false)` to opt out of sorting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `join` and `sort` keyword arguments require at least Julia 1.4.

readeach(io::IO, T)
```

Return an iterable object yielding [`read(io, T)`](@ref).

See also [`skipchars`](@ref), [`eachline`](@ref), [`readuntil`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `readeach` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");

julia> for c in readeach(io, Char)
           c == '\n' && break
           print(c)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.
```
```
readline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read a single line of text from the given I/O stream or file (defaults to `stdin`). When reading from a file, the text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. Lines in the input end with `'\n'` or `"\r\n"` or the end of an input stream. When `keep` is false (as it is by default), these trailing newline characters are removed from the line before it is returned. When `keep` is true, they are returned as part of the line.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readline("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> readline("my_file.txt", keep=true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```

```julia-repl
julia> print("Enter your name: ")
Enter your name:

julia> your_name = readline()
Logan
"Logan"
```
```
readlines(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readlines(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read all lines of an I/O stream or a file as a vector of strings. Behavior is equivalent to saving the result of reading [`readline`](@ref) repeatedly with the same arguments and saving the resulting lines as a vector of strings.  See also [`eachline`](@ref) to iterate over the lines without reading them all at once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readlines("my_file.txt")
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."
 "It has many members."

julia> readlines("my_file.txt", keep=true)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"
 "It has many members.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
readlink(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Return the target location a symbolic link `path` points to.
```
readuntil(stream::IO, delim; keep::Bool = false)
readuntil(filename::AbstractString, delim; keep::Bool = false)
```

Read a string from an I/O stream or a file, up to the given delimiter. The delimiter can be a `UInt8`, `AbstractChar`, string, or vector. Keyword argument `keep` controls whether the delimiter is included in the result. The text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", 'L')
"Julia"

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", '.', keep = true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
real(z)
```

Return the real part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`imag`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`complex`](@ref), [`isreal`](@ref), [`Real`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(1 + 3im)
1
```

```
real(T::Type)
```

Return the type that represents the real part of a value of type `T`. e.g: for `T == Complex{R}`, returns `R`. Equivalent to `typeof(real(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(Complex{Int})
Int64

julia> real(Float64)
Float64
```

```
real(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the real part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `real.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0
 3

julia> real(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
2
```
```
realpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Canonicalize a path by expanding symbolic links and removing "." and ".." entries. On case-insensitive case-preserving filesystems (typically Mac and Windows), the filesystem's stored case for the path is returned.

(This function throws an exception if `path` does not exist in the filesystem.)

Boolean type, containing the values `true` and `false`.

`Bool` is a kind of number: `false` is numerically equal to `0` and `true` is numerically equal to `1`. Moreover, `false` acts as a multiplicative "strong zero":

```jldoctest

```
redirect_stdio(;stdin=stdin, stderr=stderr, stdout=stdout)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`. Each argument must be an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


```
redirect_stdio(f; stdin=nothing, stderr=nothing, stdout=nothing)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`, call `f()` and restore each stream.

Possible values for each stream are:

  * `nothing` indicating the stream should not be redirected.
  * `path::AbstractString` redirecting the stream to the file at `path`.
  * `io` an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="stdout.txt", stderr="stderr.txt") do
           print("hello stdout")
           print(stderr, "hello stderr")
       end

julia> read("stdout.txt", String)
"hello stdout"

julia> read("stderr.txt", String)
"hello stderr"
```

# Edge cases

It is possible to pass the same argument to `stdout` and `stderr`:

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="log.txt", stderr="log.txt", stdin=devnull) do
    ...
end
```

However it is not supported to pass two distinct descriptors of the same file.

```julia-repl
julia> io1 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> io2 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io1, stderr=io2) # not suppored
```

Also the `stdin` argument may not be the same descriptor as `stdout` or `stderr`.

```julia-repl
julia> io = open(...)

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io, stdin=io) # not supported
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
redisplay(x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
redisplay(mime, x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

By default, the `redisplay` functions simply call [`display`](@ref). However, some display backends may override `redisplay` to modify an existing display of `x` (if any). Using `redisplay` is also a hint to the backend that `x` may be redisplayed several times, and the backend may choose to defer the display until (for example) the next interactive prompt.
```
reduce(op, itr; [init])
```

Reduce the given collection `itr` with the given binary operator `op`. If provided, the initial value `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

For empty collections, providing `init` will be necessary, except for some special cases (e.g. when `op` is one of `+`, `*`, `max`, `min`, `&`, `|`) when Julia can determine the neutral element of `op`.

Reductions for certain commonly-used operators may have special implementations, and should be used instead: `maximum(itr)`, `minimum(itr)`, `sum(itr)`, `prod(itr)`,  `any(itr)`, `all(itr)`.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation dependent. This means that you can't use non-associative operations like `-` because it is undefined whether `reduce(-,[1,2,3])` should be evaluated as `(1-2)-3` or `1-(2-3)`. Use [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

Some operations accumulate error. Parallelism will be easier if the reduction can be executed in groups. Future versions of Julia might change the algorithm. Note that the elements are not reordered if you use an ordered collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4])
24

julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4]; init=-1)
-24
```

```
reduce(f, A; dims=:, [init])
```

Reduce 2-argument function `f` along dimensions of `A`. `dims` is a vector specifying the dimensions to reduce, and the keyword argument `init` is the initial value to use in the reductions. For `+`, `*`, `max` and `min` the `init` argument is optional.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent; if you need a particular associativity, e.g. left-to-right, you should write your own loop or consider using [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref). See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=2)
4×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 13
 14
 15
 16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  8  12  16
```
```
reenable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Re-enable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function. Temporarily reverses the effect of [`disable_sigint`](@ref).
```
reim(z)
```

Return a tuple of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number `z`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim(1 + 3im)
(1, 3)
```

```
reim(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return a tuple of two arrays containing respectively the real and the imaginary part of each entry in `A`.

Equivalent to `(real.(A), imag.(A))`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying to represent the real part, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
([1, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4])

julia> reim(fill(2 - im))
(fill(2), fill(-1))
```
```
reinterpret(type, A)
```

Change the type-interpretation of a block of memory. For arrays, this constructs a view of the array with the same binary data as the given array, but with the specified element type. For example, `reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))` interprets the 4 bytes corresponding to `UInt32(7)` as a [`Float32`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))
1.0f-44

julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32[1 2 3 4 5])
1×5 reinterpret(Float32, ::Matrix{UInt32}):
 1.0f-45  3.0f-45  4.0f-45  6.0f-45  7.0f-45
```

```
reinterpret(reshape, T, A::AbstractArray{S}) -> B
```

Change the type-interpretation of `A` while consuming or adding a "channel dimension."

If `sizeof(T) = n*sizeof(S)` for `n>1`, `A`'s first dimension must be of size `n` and `B` lacks `A`'s first dimension. Conversely, if `sizeof(S) = n*sizeof(T)` for `n>1`, `B` gets a new first dimension of size `n`. The dimensionality is unchanged if `sizeof(T) == sizeof(S)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int}, A)    # the result is a vector
2-element reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int64}, ::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1 + 3im
 2 + 4im

julia> a = [(1,2,3), (4,5,6)]
2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}:
 (1, 2, 3)
 (4, 5, 6)

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Int, a)             # the result is a matrix
3×2 reinterpret(reshape, Int64, ::Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}) with eltype Int64:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6
```
```
relpath(path::AbstractString, startpath::AbstractString = ".") -> AbstractString
```

Return a relative filepath to `path` either from the current directory or from an optional start directory. This is a path computation: the filesystem is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of `path` or `startpath`.

On Windows, case sensitivity is applied to every part of the path except drive letters. If `path` and `startpath` refer to different drives, the absolute path of `path` is returned.
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
rem2pi(x, r::RoundingMode)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `2π`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - 2π*round(x/(2π),r)
```

without any intermediate rounding. This internally uses a high precision approximation of 2π, and so will give a more accurate result than `rem(x,2π,r)`

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is in the interval $[-π, π]$. This will generally be the most accurate result. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$ if `x` is positive,. or $[-2π, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval $[-2π, 0]$. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rem2pi(7pi/4, RoundNearest)

```
repeat(A::AbstractArray, counts::Integer...)
```

Construct an array by repeating array `A` a given number of times in each dimension, specified by `counts`.

See also: [`fill`](@ref), [`Iterators.repeated`](@ref), [`Iterators.cycle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 1
 2
 3

julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2, 3)
6×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
```

```
repeat(A::AbstractArray; inner=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)), outer=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)))
```

Construct an array by repeating the entries of `A`. The i-th element of `inner` specifies the number of times that the individual entries of the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. The i-th element of `outer` specifies the number of times that a slice along the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. If `inner` or `outer` are omitted, no repetition is performed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat(1:2, inner=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
 2

julia> repeat(1:2, outer=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:

 3  4  3  4  3  4
 3  4  3  4  3  4
```

```
repeat(s::AbstractString, r::Integer)
```

Repeat a string `r` times. This can be written as `s^r`.

See also [`^`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat("ha", 3)
"hahaha"
```

```
repeat(c::AbstractChar, r::Integer) -> String
```

Repeat a character `r` times. This can equivalently be accomplished by calling [`c^r`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat('A', 3)
"AAA"
```
```
replace(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of collection `A` where, for each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, all occurrences of `old` are replaced by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total.

The element type of the result is chosen using promotion (see [`promote_type`](@ref)) based on the element type of `A` and on the types of the `new` values in pairs. If `count` is omitted and the element type of `A` is a `Union`, the element type of the result will not include singleton types which are replaced with values of a different type: for example, `Union{T,Missing}` will become `T` if `missing` is replaced.

See also [`replace!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`insert!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace([1, 2, 1, 3], 1=>0, 2=>4, count=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 4
 1
 3

julia> replace([1, missing], missing=>0)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0
```

```
replace(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of `A` where each value `x` in `A` is replaced by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace(x -> isodd(x) ? 2x : x, [1, 2, 3, 4])
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 2
 6
 4

julia> replace(Dict(1=>2, 3=>4)) do kv
           first(kv) < 3 ? first(kv)=>3 : kv
       end
Dict{Int64, Int64} with 2 entries:
  3 => 4
  1 => 3
```

```
replace(s::AbstractString, pat=>r, [pat2=>r2, ...]; [count::Integer])
```

Search for the given pattern `pat` in `s`, and replace each occurrence with `r`. If `count` is provided, replace at most `count` occurrences. `pat` may be a single character, a vector or a set of characters, a string, or a regular expression. If `r` is a function, each occurrence is replaced with `r(s)` where `s` is the matched substring (when `pat` is a `AbstractPattern` or `AbstractString`) or character (when `pat` is an `AbstractChar` or a collection of `AbstractChar`). If `pat` is a regular expression and `r` is a [`SubstitutionString`](@ref), then capture group references in `r` are replaced with the corresponding matched text. To remove instances of `pat` from `string`, set `r` to the empty `String` (`""`).

Multiple patterns can be specified, and they will be applied left-to-right simultaneously, so only one pattern will be applied to any character, and the patterns will only be applied to the input text, not the replacements.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Support for multiple patterns requires version 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace("Python is a programming language.", "Python" => "Julia")
"Julia is a programming language."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", "quick" => "slow", count=1)
"The slow foxes run quickly."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", "quick" => "", count=1)
"The  foxes run quickly."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", r"fox(es)?" => s"bus\1")
"The quick buses run quickly."

julia> replace("abcabc", "a" => "b", "b" => "c", r".+" => "a")
"bca"
```
```
replace!(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

For each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, replace all occurrences of `old` in collection `A` by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total. See also [`replace`](@ref replace(A, old_new::Pair...)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace!([1, 2, 1, 3], 1=>0, 2=>4, count=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 4
 1
 3

julia> replace!(Set([1, 2, 3]), 1=>0)
Set{Int64} with 3 elements:
  0
  2
  3
```

```
replace!(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Replace each element `x` in collection `A` by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace!(x -> isodd(x) ? 2x : x, [1, 2, 3, 4])
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 2
 6

julia> replace!(Dict(1=>2, 3=>4)) do kv
           first(kv) < 3 ? first(kv)=>3 : kv
       end
Dict{Int64, Int64} with 2 entries:
  3 => 4
  1 => 3

julia> replace!(x->2x, Set([3, 6]))
Set{Int64} with 2 elements:
  6
  12
```
```
replaceproperty!(x, f::Symbol, expected, desired, success_order::Symbol=:not_atomic, fail_order::Symbol=success_order)
```

Perform a compare-and-swap operation on `x.f` from `expected` to `desired`, per egal. The syntax `@atomic_replace! x.f expected => desired` can be used instead of the function call form.

See also [`replacefield!`](@ref Core.replacefield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
repr(x; context=nothing)
```

Create a string from any value using the [`show`](@ref) function. You should not add methods to `repr`; define a `show` method instead.

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

Note that `repr(x)` is usually similar to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.  See also [`repr(MIME("text/plain"), x)`](@ref) to instead return a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed more for human consumption, equivalent to the REPL display of `x`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repr(1)
"1"

julia> repr(zeros(3))
"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

julia> repr(big(1/3))
"0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125"

julia> repr(big(1/3), context=:compact => true)
"0.333333"

```

```
repr(mime, x; context=nothing)
```

Returns an `AbstractString` or `Vector{UInt8}` containing the representation of `x` in the requested `mime` type, as written by [`show(io, mime, x)`](@ref) (throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if no appropriate `show` is available). An `AbstractString` is returned for MIME types with textual representations (such as `"text/html"` or `"application/postscript"`), whereas binary data is returned as `Vector{UInt8}`. (The function `istextmime(mime)` returns whether or not Julia treats a given `mime` type as text.)

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to `:key=>value` pair or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

As a special case, if `x` is an `AbstractString` (for textual MIME types) or a `Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types), the `repr` function assumes that `x` is already in the requested `mime` format and simply returns `x`. This special case does not apply to the `"text/plain"` MIME type. This is useful so that raw data can be passed to `display(m::MIME, x)`.

In particular, `repr("text/plain", x)` is typically a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed for human consumption.  See also [`repr(x)`](@ref) to instead return a string corresponding to [`show(x)`](@ref) that may be closer to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> repr("text/plain", A)
"2×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2\n 3  4"
```
```
reset(s::IO)
```

Reset a stream `s` to a previously marked position, and remove the mark. Return the previously marked position. Throw an error if the stream is not marked.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`unmark`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).

```
reset(::Event)
```

Reset an Event back into an un-set state. Then any future calls to `wait` will block until `notify` is called again.
```
reshape(A, dims...) -> AbstractArray
reshape(A, dims) -> AbstractArray
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with different dimension sizes or number of dimensions. The two arrays share the same underlying data, so that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

The new dimensions may be specified either as a list of arguments or as a shape tuple. At most one dimension may be specified with a `:`, in which case its length is computed such that its product with all the specified dimensions is equal to the length of the original array `A`. The total number of elements must not change.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:16)
16-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6

2×3 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 2, 3) with eltype Int64:
 1  3  5
 2  4  6
```
```
resize!(a::Vector, n::Integer) -> Vector
```

Resize `a` to contain `n` elements. If `n` is smaller than the current collection length, the first `n` elements will be retained. If `n` is larger, the new elements are not guaranteed to be initialized.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> resize!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 5
 4

julia> a = resize!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 8);

julia> length(a)
8

julia> a[1:6]
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
rethrow()
```

Rethrow the current exception from within a `catch` block. The rethrown exception will continue propagation as if it had not been caught.

!!! note
    The alternative form `rethrow(e)` allows you to associate an alternative exception object `e` with the current backtrace. However this misrepresents the program state at the time of the error so you're encouraged to instead throw a new exception using `throw(e)`. In Julia 1.1 and above, using `throw(e)` will preserve the root cause exception on the stack, as described in [`current_exceptions`](@ref).

```
retry(f;  delays=ExponentialBackOff(), check=nothing) -> Function
```

Return an anonymous function that calls function `f`.  If an exception arises, `f` is repeatedly called again, each time `check` returns `true`, after waiting the number of seconds specified in `delays`.  `check` should input `delays`'s current state and the `Exception`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Before Julia 1.2 this signature was restricted to `f::Function`.


# Examples

```julia
retry(f, delays=fill(5.0, 3))
retry(f, delays=rand(5:10, 2))
retry(f, delays=Base.ExponentialBackOff(n=3, first_delay=5, max_delay=1000))
retry(http_get, check=(s,e)->e.status == "503")(url)
retry(read, check=(s,e)->isa(e, IOError))(io, 128; all=false)
```
```
reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )
```

Return a copy of `v` reversed from start to stop.  See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy, and in-place [`reverse!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse(A)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5

julia> reverse(A, 3, 5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 5
 4
 3
```

```
reverse(A; dims=:)
```

Reverse `A` along dimension `dims`, which can be an integer (a single dimension), a tuple of integers (a tuple of dimensions) or `:` (reverse along all the dimensions, the default).  See also [`reverse!`](@ref) for in-place reversal.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = Int64[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reverse(b, dims=2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 4  3

julia> reverse(b)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Prior to Julia 1.6, only single-integer `dims` are supported in `reverse`.


```
reverse(s::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Reverses a string. Technically, this function reverses the codepoints in a string and its main utility is for reversed-order string processing, especially for reversed regular-expression searches. See also [`reverseind`](@ref) to convert indices in `s` to indices in `reverse(s)` and vice-versa, and `graphemes` from module `Unicode` to operate on user-visible "characters" (graphemes) rather than codepoints. See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy. Custom string types must implement the `reverse` function themselves and should typically return a string with the same type and encoding. If they return a string with a different encoding, they must also override `reverseind` for that string type to satisfy `s[reverseind(s,i)] == reverse(s)[i]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("JuliaLang")
"gnaLailuJ"
```

!!! note
    The examples below may be rendered differently on different systems. The comments indicate how they're supposed to be rendered


Combining characters can lead to surprising results:

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("ax̂e") # hat is above x in the input, above e in the output
"êxa"

julia> using Unicode

julia> join(reverse(collect(graphemes("ax̂e")))) # reverses graphemes; hat is above x in both in- and output
"ex̂a"
```

```
reverse(o::Base.Ordering)
```

reverses ordering specified by `o`.
```
reverse!(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]]) -> v
```

In-place version of [`reverse`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse!(A);

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
reverse!(A; dims=:)
```

Like [`reverse`](@ref), but operates in-place in `A`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Multidimensional `reverse!` requires Julia 1.6.

```
reverseind(v, i)
```

Given an index `i` in [`reverse(v)`](@ref), return the corresponding index in `v` so that `v[reverseind(v,i)] == reverse(v)[i]`. (This can be nontrivial in cases where `v` contains non-ASCII characters.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = "Julia🚀"
"Julia🚀"

julia> r = reverse(s)
"🚀ailuJ"

julia> for i in eachindex(s)
           print(r[reverseind(r, i)])
       end
Julia🚀
```
```
rm(path::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, recursive::Bool=false)
```

Delete the file, link, or empty directory at the given path. If `force=true` is passed, a non-existing path is not treated as error. If `recursive=true` is passed and the path is a directory, then all contents are removed recursively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> rm("my", recursive=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist", force=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist")
ERROR: IOError: unlink("this_file_does_not_exist"): no such file or directory (ENOENT)

```
```
rot180(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

```
rot180(A, k)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is even, this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a,1)

julia> rot180(a,2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

```
```
rotl90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` left 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  4
 1  3
```

```
rotl90(A, k)
```

Left-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees counterclockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a,1)

```
```
rotr90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` right 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotr90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  1
 4  2
```

```
rotr90(A, k)
```

Right-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees clockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]

round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]])
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; digits=, base=10)
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; sigdigits=, base=10)
```

Return the nearest integral value of the same type as the complex-valued `z` to `z`, breaking ties using the specified [`RoundingMode`](@ref)s. The first [`RoundingMode`](@ref) is used for rounding the real components while the second is used for rounding the imaginary components.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> round(3.14 + 4.5im)
3.0 + 4.0im
```

```
round([T,] x, [r::RoundingMode])
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; digits::Integer=0, base = 10)
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; sigdigits::Integer, base = 10)
```

Rounds the number `x`.

Without keyword arguments, `x` is rounded to an integer value, returning a value of type `T`, or of the same type of `x` if no `T` is provided. An [`InexactError`](@ref) will be thrown if the value is not representable by `T`, similar to [`convert`](@ref).

If the `digits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of digits after the decimal place (or before if negative), in base `base`.

If the `sigdigits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of significant digits, in base `base`.

The [`RoundingMode`](@ref) `r` controls the direction of the rounding; the default is [`RoundNearest`](@ref), which rounds to the nearest integer, with ties (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer. Note that `round` may give incorrect results if the global rounding mode is changed (see [`rounding`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(1.7)
2.0

julia> round(Int, 1.7)
2

julia> round(1.5)
2.0

julia> round(2.5)
2.0

julia> round(pi; digits=2)
3.14

julia> round(pi; digits=3, base=2)
3.125

julia> round(123.456; sigdigits=2)
120.0

julia> round(357.913; sigdigits=4, base=2)
352.0
```

!!! note
    Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when operating on binary floating point numbers. For example, the [`Float64`](@ref) value represented by `1.15` is actually *less* than 1.15, yet will be rounded to 1.2. For example:

    ```jldoctest; setup = :(using Printf)
    julia> x = 1.15
    1.15

    julia> @sprintf "%.20f" x
    "1.14999999999999991118"

    julia> x < 115//100
    true

    julia> round(x, digits=1)
    1.2
    ```


# Extensions

To extend `round` to new numeric types, it is typically sufficient to define `Base.round(x::NewType, r::RoundingMode)`.

```
round(dt::TimeType, p::Period, [r::RoundingMode]) -> TimeType
```

Return the `Date` or `DateTime` nearest to `dt` at resolution `p`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 9:30 to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `round(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> round(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> round(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::TimeType, ::Period, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

```
round(x::Period, precision::T, [r::RoundingMode]) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 90 minutes to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `round(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> round(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> round(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::Period, ::T, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
rounding(T)
```

Get the current floating point rounding mode for type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion.

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available modes.
```
rpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the right with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rpad("March", 20)
"March               "
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
rsplit(s::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
rsplit(s::AbstractString, chars; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
```

Similar to [`split`](@ref), but starting from the end of the string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "M.a.r.c.h"
"M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, ".")
5-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M"
 "a"
 "r"
 "c"
 "h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=1)
1-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=2)
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c"
 "h"
```
```
rstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
rstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`lstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = rpad("March", 20)
"March               "

julia> rstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
run(command, args...; wait::Bool = true)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual). Throws an error if anything goes wrong, including the process exiting with a non-zero status (when `wait` is true).

The `args...` allow you to pass through file descriptors to the command, and are ordered like regular unix file descriptors (eg `stdin, stdout, stderr, FD(3), FD(4)...`).

If `wait` is false, the process runs asynchronously. You can later wait for it and check its exit status by calling `success` on the returned process object.

When `wait` is false, the process' I/O streams are directed to `devnull`. When `wait` is true, I/O streams are shared with the parent process. Use [`pipeline`](@ref) to control I/O redirection.
No documentation found.

Binding `samefile` does not exist.
```
schedule(t::Task, [val]; error=false)
```

Add a [`Task`](@ref) to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly when the system is otherwise idle, unless the task performs a blocking operation such as [`wait`](@ref).

If a second argument `val` is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the return value of [`yieldto`](@ref)) when it runs again. If `error` is `true`, the value is raised as an exception in the woken task.

!!! warning
    It is incorrect to use `schedule` on an arbitrary `Task` that has already been started. See [the API reference](@ref low-level-schedule-wait) for more information.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a5() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a5);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
true

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
searchsorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the range of indices of `a` which compare as equal to `x` (using binary search) according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order. Return an empty range located at the insertion point if `a` does not contain values equal to `x`.

See also: [`insorted`](@ref), [`searchsortedfirst`](@ref), [`sort`](@ref), [`findall`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3:3

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4:5

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3:2

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7:6

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1:0
```
```
searchsortedfirst(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the first value in `a` greater than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `lastindex(a) + 1` if `x` is greater than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

See also: [`searchsortedlast`](@ref), [`searchsorted`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1
```
```
searchsortedlast(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the last value in `a` less than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `firstindex(a) - 1` if `x` is less than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
5

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
2

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
6

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
0

```

Compute the matrix secant of a square matrix `A`.
```
secd(x)
```

Compute the secant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```

seek(s, pos)
```

Seek a stream to the given position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
seekend(s)
```

Seek a stream to its end.
```
seekstart(s)
```

Seek a stream to its beginning.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> seekstart(io);

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
selectdim(A, d::Integer, i)
```

Return a view of all the data of `A` where the index for dimension `d` equals `i`.

Equivalent to `view(A,:,:,...,i,:,:,...)` where `i` is in position `d`.

See also: [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8]
2×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3) with eltype Int64:
 3
 7

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3:4)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3:4) with eltype Int64:
 3  4
 7  8
```
```
set_zero_subnormals(yes::Bool) -> Bool
```

If `yes` is `false`, subsequent floating-point operations follow rules for IEEE arithmetic on subnormal values ("denormals"). Otherwise, floating-point operations are permitted (but not required) to convert subnormal inputs or outputs to zero. Returns `true` unless `yes==true` but the hardware does not support zeroing of subnormal numbers.

`set_zero_subnormals(true)` can speed up some computations on some hardware. However, it can break identities such as `(x-y==0) == (x==y)`.

!!! warning
    This function only affects the current thread.

```
setcpuaffinity(original_command::Cmd, cpus) -> command::Cmd
```

Set the CPU affinity of the `command` by a list of CPU IDs (1-based) `cpus`.  Passing `cpus = nothing` means to unset the CPU affinity if the `original_command` has any.

This function is supported only in Linux and Windows.  It is not supported in macOS because libuv does not support affinity setting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

In Linux, the `taskset` command line program can be used to see how `setcpuaffinity` works.

```julia
julia> run(setcpuaffinity(`sh -c 'taskset -p $$'`, [1, 2, 5]));
pid 2273's current affinity mask: 13
```

Note that the mask value `13` reflects that the first, second, and the fifth bits (counting from the least significant position) are turned on:

```julia
julia> 0b010011
0x13
```
```
setdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set of elements in `s` but not in any of the iterables in `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

See also [`setdiff!`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> setdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
setdiff!(s, itrs...)
```

Remove from set `s` (in-place) each element of each iterable from `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([1, 3, 4, 5]);

julia> setdiff!(a, 1:2:6);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  4
```
```
setenv(command::Cmd, env; dir)
```

Set environment variables to use when running the given `command`. `env` is either a dictionary mapping strings to strings, an array of strings of the form `"var=val"`, or zero or more `"var"=>val` pair arguments. In order to modify (rather than replace) the existing environment, create `env` through `copy(ENV)` and then setting `env["var"]=val` as desired, or use [`addenv`](@ref).

The `dir` keyword argument can be used to specify a working directory for the command. `dir` defaults to the currently set `dir` for `command` (which is the current working directory if not specified already).

See also [`Cmd`](@ref), [`addenv`](@ref), [`ENV`](@ref), [`pwd`](@ref).
```
setindex!(collection, value, key...)
```

Store the given value at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...] = x` is converted by the compiler to `(setindex!(a, x, i, j, ...); x)`.

```
setindex!(A, X, inds...)
A[inds...] = X
```

Store values from array `X` within some subset of `A` as specified by `inds`. The syntax `A[inds...] = X` is equivalent to `(setindex!(A, X, inds...); X)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,2);

julia> setindex!(A, [10, 20], [1, 2]);

julia> A[[3, 4]] = [30, 40];

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 10.0  30.0
 20.0  40.0
```
```
setprecision([T=BigFloat,] precision::Int; base=2)
```

Set the precision (in bits, by default) to be used for `T` arithmetic. If `base` is specified, then the precision is the minimum required to give at least `precision` digits in the given `base`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.


```
setprecision(f::Function, [T=BigFloat,] precision::Integer; base=2)
```

Change the `T` arithmetic precision (in the given `base`) for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = precision(BigFloat)
setprecision(BigFloat, precision)
f()
setprecision(BigFloat, old)
```

Often used as `setprecision(T, precision) do ... end`

Note: `nextfloat()`, `prevfloat()` do not use the precision mentioned by `setprecision`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x)
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b = c` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

See also [`setfield!`](@ref Core.setfield!), [`propertynames`](@ref Base.propertynames) and [`getproperty`](@ref Base.getproperty).
```
setrounding(T, mode)
```

Set the rounding mode of floating point type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion. Other numerical functions may give incorrect or invalid values when using rounding modes other than the default [`RoundNearest`](@ref).

Note that this is currently only supported for `T == BigFloat`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


```
setrounding(f::Function, T, mode)
```

Change the rounding mode of floating point type `T` for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = rounding(T)
setrounding(T, mode)
f()
setrounding(T, old)
```

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available rounding modes.
```
show([io::IO = stdout], x)
```

Write a text representation of a value `x` to the output stream `io`. New types `T` should overload `show(io::IO, x::T)`. The representation used by `show` generally includes Julia-specific formatting and type information, and should be parseable Julia code when possible.

[`repr`](@ref) returns the output of `show` as a string.

To customize human-readable text output for objects of type `T`, define `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` instead. Checking the `:compact` [`IOContext`](@ref) property of `io` in such methods is recommended, since some containers show their elements by calling this method with `:compact => true`.

See also [`print`](@ref), which writes un-decorated representations.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> show("Hello World!")
"Hello World!"
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```

```
show(io::IO, mime, x)
```

The [`display`](@ref) functions ultimately call `show` in order to write an object `x` as a given `mime` type to a given I/O stream `io` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary to define a new `show` method for `T`, via: `show(io, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`, where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls [`write`](@ref) (or similar) to write that representation of `x` to `io`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use `MIME{Symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function `show(io, ::MIME"image/png", x::MyImage) = ...` to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable `AbstractDisplay` (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to `import Base.show` in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function `show`.

Technically, the `MIME"mime"` macro defines a singleton type for the given `mime` string, which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any given type.

The default MIME type is `MIME"text/plain"`. There is a fallback definition for `text/plain` output that calls `show` with 2 arguments, so it is not always necessary to add a method for that case. If a type benefits from custom human-readable output though, `show(::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` should be defined. For example, the `Day` type uses `1 day` as the output for the `text/plain` MIME type, and `Day(1)` as the output of 2-argument `show`.

Container types generally implement 3-argument `show` by calling `show(io, MIME"text/plain"(), x)` for elements `x`, with `:compact => true` set in an [`IOContext`](@ref) passed as the first argument.
```
showable(mime, x)
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object `x` can be written as the given `mime` type.

(By default, this is determined automatically by the existence of the corresponding [`show`](@ref) method for `typeof(x)`.  Some types provide custom `showable` methods; for example, if the available MIME formats depend on the *value* of `x`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> showable(MIME("text/plain"), rand(5))
true

julia> showable("image/png", rand(5))
false
```
```
showerror(io, e)
```

Show a descriptive representation of an exception object `e`. This method is used to display the exception after a call to [`throw`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyException <: Exception
           msg::String
       end

julia> function Base.showerror(io::IO, err::MyException)
           print(io, "MyException: ")
           print(io, err.msg)
       end

julia> err = MyException("test exception")
MyException("test exception")

julia> sprint(showerror, err)
"MyException: test exception"

julia> throw(MyException("test exception"))
ERROR: MyException: test exception
```
```
sign(x)
```

Return zero if `x==0` and $x/|x|$ otherwise (i.e., ±1 for real `x`).

See also [`signbit`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref), [`copysign`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sign(-4.0)
-1.0

julia> sign(99)
1

julia> sign(-0.0)
-0.0

julia> sign(0 + im)
0.0 + 1.0im
```
```
signbit(x)
```

Returns `true` if the value of the sign of `x` is negative, otherwise `false`.

See also [`sign`](@ref) and [`copysign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signbit(-4)
true

julia> signbit(5)
false

julia> signbit(5.5)
false

julia> signbit(-4.1)
true
```
```
signed(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the signed type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signed(UInt16)
Int16
julia> signed(UInt64)
Int64
```

```
signed(x)
```

Convert a number to a signed integer. If the argument is unsigned, it is reinterpreted as signed without checking for overflow.

See also: [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).
```
significand(x)
```

Extract the significand (a.k.a. mantissa) of a floating-point number. If `x` is a non-zero finite number, then the result will be a number of the same type and sign as `x`, and whose absolute value is on the interval $[1,2)$. Otherwise `x` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> significand(15.2)
1.9

julia> significand(-15.2)
-1.9

julia> significand(-15.2) * 2^3
-15.2

julia> significand(-Inf), significand(Inf), significand(NaN)
(-Inf, Inf, NaN)
```
```
similar(array, [element_type=eltype(array)], [dims=size(array)])
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array with the given element type and size, based upon the given source array. The second and third arguments are both optional, defaulting to the given array's `eltype` and `size`. The dimensions may be specified either as a single tuple argument or as a series of integer arguments.

Custom AbstractArray subtypes may choose which specific array type is best-suited to return for the given element type and dimensionality. If they do not specialize this method, the default is an `Array{element_type}(undef, dims...)`.

For example, `similar(1:10, 1, 4)` returns an uninitialized `Array{Int,2}` since ranges are neither mutable nor support 2 dimensions:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(1:10, 1, 4)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4419743872  4374413872  4419743888  0
```

Conversely, `similar(trues(10,10), 2)` returns an uninitialized `BitVector` with two elements since `BitArray`s are both mutable and can support 1-dimensional arrays:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(trues(10,10), 2)
2-element BitVector:
 0
 0
```

Since `BitArray`s can only store elements of type [`Bool`](@ref), however, if you request a different element type it will create a regular `Array` instead:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(falses(10), Float64, 2, 4)
2×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
```

See also: [`undef`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

```
similar(storagetype, axes)
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array analogous to that specified by `storagetype`, but with `axes` specified by the last argument.

**Examples**:

```
similar(Array{Int}, axes(A))
```

creates an array that "acts like" an `Array{Int}` (and might indeed be backed by one), but which is indexed identically to `A`. If `A` has conventional indexing, this will be identical to `Array{Int}(undef, size(A))`, but if `A` has unconventional indexing then the indices of the result will match `A`.

```
similar(BitArray, (axes(A, 2),))
```

would create a 1-dimensional logical array whose indices match those of the columns of `A`.
```
sin(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`sind`], [`sinpi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
sin(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the sine. Otherwise, the sine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sin(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649
```
```
sinc(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x) / (\pi x)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $1$ if $x = 0$.

See also [`cosc`](@ref), its derivative.
```
sincos(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians, returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

See also [`cis`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref).

```
sincos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine and cosine of a square matrix `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> S, C = sincos(fill(1.0, (2,2)));

julia> S
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649

julia> C
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
sincosd(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
sincospi(x)
```

Simultaneously compute [`sinpi(x)`](@ref) and [`cospi(x)`](@ref) (the sine and cosine of `π*x`, where `x` is in radians), returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.


See also: [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref), [`sinpi`](@ref).
```
sind(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
sinh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic sine of `x`.

```
sinh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic sine of a square matrix `A`.
```
sinpi(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x)$ more accurately than `sin(pi*x)`, especially for large `x`.

See also [`sind`](@ref), [`cospi`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref).
```
size(A::AbstractArray, [dim])
```

Return a tuple containing the dimensions of `A`. Optionally you can specify a dimension to just get the length of that dimension.

Note that `size` may not be defined for arrays with non-standard indices, in which case [`axes`](@ref) may be useful. See the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

See also: [`length`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`sizeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (2,3,4));

julia> size(A)
(2, 3, 4)

julia> size(A, 2)
3
```
```
sizehint!(s, n)
```

Suggest that collection `s` reserve capacity for at least `n` elements. This can improve performance.

# Notes on the performance model

For types that support `sizehint!`,

1. `push!` and `append!` methods generally may (but are not required to) preallocate extra storage. For types implemented in `Base`, they typically do, using a heuristic optimized for a general use case.
2. `sizehint!` may control this preallocation. Again, it typically does this for types in `Base`.
3. `empty!` is nearly costless (and O(1)) for types that support this kind of preallocation.
```
sizeof(T::DataType)
sizeof(obj)
```

Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given `DataType` `T`, if any. Or the size, in bytes, of object `obj` if it is not a `DataType`.

See also [`summarysize`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(Float32)
4

julia> sizeof(ComplexF64)
16

julia> sizeof(1.0)
8

julia> sizeof(collect(1.0:10.0))
80
```

If `DataType` `T` does not have a specific size, an error is thrown.

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(AbstractArray)
ERROR: Abstract type AbstractArray does not have a definite size.
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
sizeof(str::AbstractString)
```

Size, in bytes, of the string `str`. Equal to the number of code units in `str` multiplied by the size, in bytes, of one code unit in `str`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof("")
0

julia> sizeof("∀")
3
```
```
skip(s, offset)
```

Seek a stream relative to the current position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> skip(io, 10);

julia> read(io, Char)
'G': ASCII/Unicode U+0047 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
skipchars(predicate, io::IO; linecomment=nothing)
```

Advance the stream `io` such that the next-read character will be the first remaining for which `predicate` returns `false`. If the keyword argument `linecomment` is specified, all characters from that character until the start of the next line are ignored.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> buf = IOBuffer("    text")
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> skipchars(isspace, buf)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=5, mark=-1)

julia> String(readavailable(buf))
"text"
```
```
skipmissing(itr)
```

Return an iterator over the elements in `itr` skipping [`missing`](@ref) values. The returned object can be indexed using indices of `itr` if the latter is indexable. Indices corresponding to missing values are not valid: they are skipped by [`keys`](@ref) and [`eachindex`](@ref), and a `MissingException` is thrown when trying to use them.

Use [`collect`](@ref) to obtain an `Array` containing the non-`missing` values in `itr`. Note that even if `itr` is a multidimensional array, the result will always be a `Vector` since it is not possible to remove missings while preserving dimensions of the input.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`ismissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = skipmissing([1, missing, 2])
skipmissing(Union{Missing, Int64}[1, missing, 2])

julia> sum(x)
3

julia> x[1]
1

julia> x[2]
ERROR: MissingException: the value at index (2,) is missing
[...]

julia> argmax(x)
3

julia> collect(keys(x))
2-element Vector{Int64}:

 3

julia> collect(skipmissing([1, missing, 2]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:

 2

julia> collect(skipmissing([1 missing; 2 missing]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
sleep(seconds)
```

Block the current task for a specified number of seconds. The minimum sleep time is 1 millisecond or input of `0.001`.
```
something(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`nothing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise throw an error. Arguments of type [`Some`](@ref) are unwrapped.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`@something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> something(nothing, 1)

julia> something(missing, nothing)
missing

julia> something(nothing, nothing)
ERROR: ArgumentError: No value arguments present
```
```
sort(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Variant of [`sort!`](@ref) that returns a sorted copy of `v` leaving `v` itself unmodified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> sort(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 1
 2
```

```
sort(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort a multidimensional array `A` along the given dimension. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort(A, dims = 1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 4  3

julia> sort(A, dims = 2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  4
 1  2
```
```
sort!(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the vector `v` in place. [`QuickSort`](@ref) is used by default for numeric arrays while [`MergeSort`](@ref) is used for other arrays. You can specify an algorithm to use via the `alg` keyword (see [Sorting Algorithms](@ref) for available algorithms). The `by` keyword lets you provide a function that will be applied to each element before comparison; the `lt` keyword allows providing a custom "less than" function (note that for every `x` and `y`, only one of `lt(x,y)` and `lt(y,x)` can return `true`); use `rev=true` to reverse the sorting order. These options are independent and can be used together in all possible combinations: if both `by` and `lt` are specified, the `lt` function is applied to the result of the `by` function; `rev=true` reverses whatever ordering specified via the `by` and `lt` keywords.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; sort!(v); v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; sort!(v, rev = true); v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 2
 1

julia> v = [(1, "c"), (3, "a"), (2, "b")]; sort!(v, by = x -> x[1]); v
3-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, String}}:
 (1, "c")
 (2, "b")
 (3, "a")

julia> v = [(1, "c"), (3, "a"), (2, "b")]; sort!(v, by = x -> x[2]); v
3-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, String}}:
 (3, "a")
 (2, "b")
 (1, "c")
```

```
sort!(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=defalg(A), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the multidimensional array `A` along dimension `dims`. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort!(A, dims = 1); A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 4  3

julia> sort!(A, dims = 2); A

 1  2
 3  4
```
```
sortperm(v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Return a permutation vector `I` that puts `v[I]` in sorted order. The order is specified using the same keywords as [`sort!`](@ref). The permutation is guaranteed to be stable even if the sorting algorithm is unstable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

See also [`sortperm!`](@ref), [`partialsortperm`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref), [`indexin`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> p = sortperm(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortperm!(ix, v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward, initialized::Bool=false)
```

Like [`sortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix`.  If `initialized` is `false` (the default), `ix` is initialized to contain the values `1:length(v)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; p = zeros(Int, 3);

julia> sortperm!(p, v); p
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortslices(A; dims, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort slices of an array `A`. The required keyword argument `dims` must be either an integer or a tuple of integers. It specifies the dimension(s) over which the slices are sorted.

E.g., if `A` is a matrix, `dims=1` will sort rows, `dims=2` will sort columns. Note that the default comparison function on one dimensional slices sorts lexicographically.

For the remaining keyword arguments, see the documentation of [`sort!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1) # Sort rows
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1   6  4
  7   3  5
  9  -2  8

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5
 -1   6  4

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, rev=true)
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5
 -1   6  4

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2) # Sort columns
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  3   5  7
 -1  -4  6
 -2   8  9

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, alg=InsertionSort, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  5   3  7
 -4  -1  6
  8  -2  9

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, rev=true)
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 7   5   3
 6  -4  -1
 9   8  -2
```

# Higher dimensions

`sortslices` extends naturally to higher dimensions. E.g., if `A` is a a 2x2x2 array, `sortslices(A, dims=3)` will sort slices within the 3rd dimension, passing the 2x2 slices `A[:, :, 1]` and `A[:, :, 2]` to the comparison function. Note that while there is no default order on higher-dimensional slices, you may use the `by` or `lt` keyword argument to specify such an order.

If `dims` is a tuple, the order of the dimensions in `dims` is relevant and specifies the linear order of the slices. E.g., if `A` is three dimensional and `dims` is `(1, 2)`, the orderings of the first two dimensions are re-arranged such that the slices (of the remaining third dimension) are sorted. If `dims` is `(2, 1)` instead, the same slices will be taken, but the result order will be row-major instead.

# Higher dimensional examples

```
julia> A = permutedims(reshape([4 3; 2 1; 'A' 'B'; 'C' 'D'], (2, 2, 2)), (1, 3, 2))

splice!(a::Vector, index::Integer, [replacement]) -> item
```

Remove the item at the given index, and return the removed item. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gap. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed item.

See also: [`replace`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`pop!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; splice!(A, 5)
2

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6

julia> A
7-element Vector{Int64}:
 -1
 -2
 -3
  5
  4
  3
 -1
```

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

```
splice!(a::Vector, indices, [replacement]) -> items
```

Remove items at specified indices, and return a collection containing the removed items. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gaps. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed items; in this case, `indices` must be a `AbstractUnitRange`.

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Prior to Julia 1.5, `indices` must always be a `UnitRange`.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Prior to Julia 1.8, `indices` must be a `UnitRange` if splicing in replacement values.


# Examples

```
```
split(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
split(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` into an array of substrings on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm`.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`rsplit`](@ref), [`eachsplit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> split(a, ".")
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
splitdir(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

Split a path into a tuple of the directory name and file name.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitdir("/home/myuser")
("/home", "myuser")
```
```
splitdrive(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

On Windows, split a path into the drive letter part and the path part. On Unix systems, the first component is always the empty string.
```
splitext(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

If the last component of a path contains one or more dots, split the path into everything before the last dot and everything including and after the dot. Otherwise, return a tuple of the argument unmodified and the empty string. "splitext" is short for "split extension".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.jl")
("/home/myuser/example", ".jl")

julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.tar.gz")
("/home/myuser/example.tar", ".gz")

julia> splitext("/home/my.user/example")
("/home/my.user/example", "")
```
```
splitpath(path::AbstractString) -> Vector{String}
```

Split a file path into all its path components. This is the opposite of `joinpath`. Returns an array of substrings, one for each directory or file in the path, including the root directory if present.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitpath("/home/myuser/example.jl")
4-element Vector{String}:
 "/"
 "home"
 "myuser"
 "example.jl"
```
```
sprint(f::Function, args...; context=nothing, sizehint=0)
```

Call the given function with an I/O stream and the supplied extra arguments. Everything written to this I/O stream is returned as a string. `context` can be an [`IOContext`](@ref) whose properties will be used, a `Pair` specifying a property and its value, or a tuple of `Pair` specifying multiple properties and their values. `sizehint` suggests the capacity of the buffer (in bytes).

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `f`.  The optional `sizehint` is a suggested size (in bytes) to allocate for the buffer used to write the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sprint(show, 66.66666; context=:compact => true)
"66.6667"

julia> sprint(showerror, BoundsError([1], 100))
"BoundsError: attempt to access 1-element Vector{Int64} at index [100]"
```
```
sqrt(x)
```

Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.

See also: [`hypot`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"

```
sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

If `A` is real-symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root.   For such matrices, eigenvalues λ that appear to be slightly negative due to roundoff errors are treated as if they were zero. More precisely, matrices with all eigenvalues `≥ -rtol*(max |λ|)` are treated as semidefinite (yielding a Hermitian square root), with negative eigenvalues taken to be zero. `rtol` is a keyword argument to `sqrt` (in the Hermitian/real-symmetric case only) that defaults to machine precision scaled by `size(A,1)`.

Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor. If a real square root exists, then an extension of this method [^H87] that computes the real Schur form and then the real square root of the quasi-triangular factor is instead used.

```
stacktrace([trace::Vector{Ptr{Cvoid}},] [c_funcs::Bool=false]) -> StackTrace
```

Returns a stack trace in the form of a vector of `StackFrame`s. (By default stacktrace doesn't return C functions, but this can be enabled.) When called without specifying a trace, `stacktrace` first calls `backtrace`.
```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with `prefix`. If `prefix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the first character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`endswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", "Julia")
true
```

```
startswith(prefix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument starts with `prefix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> startswith(y, prefix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(startswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `startswith(prefix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith_julia = startswith("Julia");

julia> startswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> startswith_julia("NotJulia")
false
```

```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with the regex pattern, `prefix`.

!!! note
    `startswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"^...", s)` is faster than `startswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`endswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", r"Julia|Romeo")

```
step(r)
```

Get the step size of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) object.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> step(1:10)
1

julia> step(1:2:10)
2

julia> step(2.5:0.3:10.9)
0.3

julia> step(range(2.5, stop=10.9, length=85))
0.1
```
```
stride(A, k::Integer)
```

Return the distance in memory (in number of elements) between adjacent elements in dimension `k`.

See also: [`strides`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> stride(A,2)
3

julia> stride(A,3)
12
```
```
strides(A)
```

Return a tuple of the memory strides in each dimension.

See also: [`stride`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> strides(A)
(1, 3, 12)
```
```
string(n::Integer; base::Integer = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Convert an integer `n` to a string in the given `base`, optionally specifying a number of digits to pad to.

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string(5, base = 13, pad = 4)
"0005"

julia> string(-13, base = 5, pad = 4)
"-0023"
```

```
string(xs...)
```

Create a string from any values using the [`print`](@ref) function.

`string` should usually not be defined directly. Instead, define a method `print(io::IO, x::MyType)`. If `string(x)` for a certain type needs to be highly efficient, then it may make sense to add a method to `string` and define `print(io::IO, x::MyType) = print(io, string(x))` to ensure the functions are consistent.

See also: [`String`](@ref), [`repr`](@ref), [`sprint`](@ref), [`show`](@ref @show).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string("a", 1, true)
"a1true"
```
```
strip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
strip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading and trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading and trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, vector or set of characters.

See also [`lstrip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The method which accepts a predicate function requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strip("{3, 5}\n", ['{', '}', '\n'])
"3, 5"
```
```
success(command)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual), and tell whether it was successful (exited with a code of 0). An exception is raised if the process cannot be started.
```
sum(f, itr; [init])
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
29
```

Note the important difference between `sum(A)` and `reduce(+, A)` for arrays with small integer eltype:

```jldoctest
julia> sum(Int8[100, 28])
128

julia> reduce(+, Int8[100, 28])
-128
```

In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is 128. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in -128.

```
sum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the sum of all elements in a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum(1:20)
210

julia> sum(1:20; init = 0.0)
210.0
```

```
sum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Sum elements of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  6

julia> sum(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 3
 7
```

```
sum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum(abs2, A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 10  20

julia> sum(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  5
 25
```
```
sum!(r, A)
```

Sum elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum!([1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 7

julia> sum!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  6
```
```
summary(io::IO, x)
str = summary(x)
```

Print to a stream `io`, or return a string `str`, giving a brief description of a value. By default returns `string(typeof(x))`, e.g. [`Int64`](@ref).

For arrays, returns a string of size and type info, e.g. `10-element Array{Int64,1}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> summary(1)
"Int64"

julia> summary(zeros(2))
"2-element Vector{Float64}"
```
```
supertype(T::DataType)
```

Return the supertype of DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> supertype(Int32)
Signed
```
```
swapproperty!(x, f::Symbol, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic a.b, _ = c, a.b` returns `(c, swapproperty!(a, :b, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where there must be one getfield expression common to both sides.

See also [`swapfield!`](@ref Core.swapfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
symdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of elements in the passed in sets. When `s` is not an `AbstractSet`, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.

See also [`symdiff!`](@ref), [`setdiff`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> symdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5], [4,5,6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> symdiff([1,2,1], [2, 1, 2])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> symdiff(unique([1,2,1]), unique([2, 1, 2]))
Int64[]
```
```
symdiff!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of the passed in sets, and overwrite `s` with the result. When `s` is an array, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.
```
symlink(target::AbstractString, link::AbstractString; dir_target = false)
```

Creates a symbolic link to `target` with the name `link`.

On Windows, symlinks must be explicitly declared as referring to a directory or not.  If `target` already exists, by default the type of `link` will be auto- detected, however if `target` does not exist, this function defaults to creating a file symlink unless `dir_target` is set to `true`.  Note that if the user sets `dir_target` but `target` exists and is a file, a directory symlink will still be created, but dereferencing the symlink will fail, just as if the user creates a file symlink (by calling `symlink()` with `dir_target` set to `false` before the directory is created) and tries to dereference it to a directory.

Additionally, there are two methods of making a link on Windows; symbolic links and junction points.  Junction points are slightly more efficient, but do not support relative paths, so if a relative directory symlink is requested (as denoted by `isabspath(target)` returning `false`) a symlink will be used, else a junction point will be used.  Best practice for creating symlinks on Windows is to create them only after the files/directories they reference are already created.

See also: [`hardlink`](@ref).

!!! note
    This function raises an error under operating systems that do not support soft symbolic links, such as Windows XP.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The `dir_target` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.6.  Prior to this, symlinks to nonexistant paths on windows would always be file symlinks, and relative symlinks to directories were not supported.

```
systemerror(sysfunc[, errno::Cint=Libc.errno()])
systemerror(sysfunc, iftrue::Bool)
```

Raises a `SystemError` for `errno` with the descriptive string `sysfunc` if `iftrue` is `true`
```
take!(b::IOBuffer)
```

Obtain the contents of an `IOBuffer` as an array. Afterwards, the `IOBuffer` is reset to its initial state.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."
```

```
take!(c::Channel)
```

Remove and return a value from a [`Channel`](@ref). Blocks until data is available.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`put!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

```
take!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Fetch value(s) from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) `rr`, removing the value(s) in the process.
```
tan(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
tan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the tangent. Otherwise, the tangent is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tan(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 -1.09252  -1.09252
 -1.09252  -1.09252
```
```
tand(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
tanh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
tanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic tangent of a square matrix `A`.
```
task_local_storage(key)
```

Look up the value of a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(key, value)
```

Assign a value to a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(body, key, value)
```

Call the function `body` with a modified task-local storage, in which `value` is assigned to `key`; the previous value of `key`, or lack thereof, is restored afterwards. Useful for emulating dynamic scoping.
```
tempdir()
```

Gets the path of the temporary directory. On Windows, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMP`, `TEMP`, `USERPROFILE`. On all other operating systems, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, and `TEMPDIR`. If none of these are found, the path `"/tmp"` is used.
```
tempname(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> String
```

Generate a temporary file path. This function only returns a path; no file is created. The path is likely to be unique, but this cannot be guaranteed due to the very remote posibility of two simultaneous calls to `tempname` generating the same file name. The name is guaranteed to differ from all files already existing at the time of the call to `tempname`.

When called with no arguments, the temporary name will be an absolute path to a temporary name in the system temporary directory as given by `tempdir()`. If a `parent` directory argument is given, the temporary path will be in that directory instead.

The `cleanup` option controls whether the process attempts to delete the returned path automatically when the process exits. Note that the `tempname` function does not create any file or directory at the returned location, so there is nothing to cleanup unless you create a file or directory there. If you do and `clean` is `true` it will be deleted upon process termination.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `parent` and `cleanup` arguments were added in 1.4. Prior to Julia 1.4 the path `tempname` would never be cleaned up at process termination.


!!! warning
    This can lead to security holes if another process obtains the same file name and creates the file before you are able to. Open the file with `JL_O_EXCL` if this is a concern. Using [`mktemp()`](@ref) is also recommended instead.

```
textwidth(c)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth('α')
1

julia> textwidth('⛵')
2
```

```
textwidth(s::AbstractString)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth("March")
5
```
```
thisind(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Int
```

If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding code unit `i` is part of. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return `i`; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to 0 or `ncodeunits(s)+1` return `i`. In all other cases throw `BoundsError`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> thisind("α", 0)
0

julia> thisind("α", 1)
1

julia> thisind("α", 2)
1

julia> thisind("α", 3)
3

julia> thisind("α", 4)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [4]
[...]

julia> thisind("α", -1)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [-1]
[...]
```
```
time(t::TmStruct)
```

Converts a `TmStruct` struct to a number of seconds since the epoch.

```
time()
```

Get the system time in seconds since the epoch, with fairly high (typically, microsecond) resolution.
```
time_ns()
```

Get the time in nanoseconds. The time corresponding to 0 is undefined, and wraps every 5.8 years.
```
timedwait(callback::Function, timeout::Real; pollint::Real=0.1)
```

Waits until `callback` returns `true` or `timeout` seconds have passed, whichever is earlier. `callback` is polled every `pollint` seconds. The minimum value for `timeout` and `pollint` is `0.001`, that is, 1 millisecond.

Returns :ok or :timed_out
```
titlecase(s::AbstractString; [wordsep::Function], strict::Bool=true) -> String
```

Capitalize the first character of each word in `s`; if `strict` is true, every other character is converted to lowercase, otherwise they are left unchanged. By default, all non-letters beginning a new grapheme are considered as word separators; a predicate can be passed as the `wordsep` keyword to determine which characters should be considered as word separators. See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref) to capitalize only the first character in `s`.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> titlecase("the JULIA programming language")
"The Julia Programming Language"

julia> titlecase("ISS - international space station", strict=false)
"ISS - International Space Station"

julia> titlecase("a-a b-b", wordsep = c->c==' ')
"A-a B-b"
```
```
to_indices(A, I::Tuple)
```

Convert the tuple `I` to a tuple of indices for use in indexing into array `A`.

The returned tuple must only contain either `Int`s or `AbstractArray`s of scalar indices that are supported by array `A`. It will error upon encountering a novel index type that it does not know how to process.

For simple index types, it defers to the unexported `Base.to_index(A, i)` to process each index `i`. While this internal function is not intended to be called directly, `Base.to_index` may be extended by custom array or index types to provide custom indexing behaviors.

More complicated index types may require more context about the dimension into which they index. To support those cases, `to_indices(A, I)` calls `to_indices(A, axes(A), I)`, which then recursively walks through both the given tuple of indices and the dimensional indices of `A` in tandem. As such, not all index types are guaranteed to propagate to `Base.to_index`.
```
touch(path::AbstractString)
```

Update the last-modified timestamp on a file to the current time.

If the file does not exist a new file is created.

Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> write("my_little_file", 2);

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.5273815391135583e9

julia> touch("my_little_file");

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.527381559163435e9
```

We can see the [`mtime`](@ref) has been modified by `touch`.
```
trailing_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_ones(3)
2
```
```
trailing_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_zeros(2)
1
```
```
transcode(T, src)
```

Convert string data between Unicode encodings. `src` is either a `String` or a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-XX code units, where `XX` is 8, 16, or 32. `T` indicates the encoding of the return value: `String` to return a (UTF-8 encoded) `String` or `UIntXX` to return a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-`XX` data. (The alias [`Cwchar_t`](@ref) can also be used as the integer type, for converting `wchar_t*` strings used by external C libraries.)

The `transcode` function succeeds as long as the input data can be reasonably represented in the target encoding; it always succeeds for conversions between UTF-XX encodings, even for invalid Unicode data.

Only conversion to/from UTF-8 is currently supported.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγ"
"αβγ"

julia> transcode(UInt16, str)
3-element Vector{UInt16}:
 0x03b1
 0x03b2
 0x03b3

julia> transcode(String, transcode(UInt16, str))
"αβγ"
```
```
transpose(A)
```

Lazy transpose. Mutating the returned object should appropriately mutate `A`. Often, but not always, yields `Transpose(A)`, where `Transpose` is a lazy transpose wrapper. Note that this operation is recursive.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3+2im  8+7im
 9+2im  4+6im
```
```
trues(dims)
```

Create a `BitArray` with all values set to `true`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trues(2,3)
2×3 BitMatrix:
 1  1  1
 1  1  1
```
```
trunc([T,] x)
trunc(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
trunc(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`trunc(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`.

`trunc(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

See also: [`%`](@ref rem), [`floor`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`unsafe_trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(2.22)
2.0

julia> trunc(-2.22, digits=1)
-2.2

julia> trunc(Int, -2.22)
-2
```

```
trunc(dt::TimeType, ::Type{Period}) -> TimeType
```

Truncates the value of `dt` according to the provided `Period` type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(Dates.DateTime("1996-01-01T12:30:00"), Dates.Day)
1996-01-01T00:00:00
```
```
truncate(file, n)
```

Resize the file or buffer given by the first argument to exactly `n` bytes, filling previously unallocated space with '\0' if the file or buffer is grown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.")
35

julia> truncate(io, 15)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=15, maxsize=Inf, ptr=16, mark=-1)

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a "

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> truncate(io, 40);

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\0\0\0\0\0"
```
```
trylock(lock) -> Success (Boolean)
```

Acquire the lock if it is available, and return `true` if successful. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, return `false`.

Each successful `trylock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).
```
tryparse(type, str; base)
```

Like [`parse`](@ref), but returns either a value of the requested type, or [`nothing`](@ref) if the string does not contain a valid number.
```
typeintersect(T::Type, S::Type)
```

Compute a type that contains the intersection of `T` and `S`. Usually this will be the smallest such type or one close to it.
```
typejoin(T, S)
```

Return the closest common ancestor of `T` and `S`, i.e. the narrowest type from which they both inherit.
```
typemax(T)
```

The highest value representable by the given (real) numeric `DataType`.

See also: [`floatmax`](@ref), [`typemin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemax(Int8)
127

julia> typemax(UInt32)
0xffffffff

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf

julia> floatmax(Float32)  # largest finite floating point number
3.4028235f38
```
```
typemin(T)
```

The lowest value representable by the given (real) numeric DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemin(Float16)
-Inf16

julia> typemin(Float32)
-Inf32
```
```
unescape_string(str::AbstractString, keep = ())::AbstractString
unescape_string(io, s::AbstractString, keep = ())::Nothing
```

General unescaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`. The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which (along with backlashes) are to be kept as they are.

The following escape sequences are recognised:

  * Escaped backslash (`\\`)
  * Escaped double-quote (`\"`)
  * Standard C escape sequences (`\a`, `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\v`, `\f`, `\r`, `\e`)
  * Unicode BMP code points (`\u` with 1-4 trailing hex digits)
  * All Unicode code points (`\U` with 1-8 trailing hex digits; max value = 0010ffff)
  * Hex bytes (`\x` with 1-2 trailing hex digits)
  * Octal bytes (`\` with 1-3 trailing octal digits)

See also [`escape_string`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unescape_string("aaa\\nbbb") # C escape sequence
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> unescape_string("\\u03c0") # unicode
"π"

julia> unescape_string("\\101") # octal
"A"

julia> unescape_string("aaa \\g \\n", ['g']) # using `keep` argument
"aaa \\g \n"
```
```
union(s, itrs...)
∪(s, itrs...)
```

Construct an object containing all distinct elements from all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∪` can be typed by writing `\cup` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∪ itr`.

See also [`unique`](@ref), [`intersect`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`Iterators.flatten`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> union([1, 2], [3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> union([4 2 3 4 4], 1:3, 3.0)
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 4.0
 2.0
 3.0
 1.0

julia> (0, 0.0) ∪ (-0.0, NaN)
3-element Vector{Real}:
   0
  -0.0

julia> union(Set([1, 2]), 2:3)
Set{Int64} with 3 elements:
  2
  3
  1
```
```
union!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the [`union`](@ref) of passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([3, 4, 5]);

julia> union!(a, 1:2:7);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 5 elements:
  5
  4
  7
  3
  1
```
```
unique(itr)
```

Return an array containing only the unique elements of collection `itr`, as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), in the order that the first of each set of equivalent elements originally appears. The element type of the input is preserved.

See also: [`unique!`](@ref), [`allunique`](@ref), [`allequal`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique([1, 2, 6, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> unique(Real[1, 1.0, 2])
2-element Vector{Real}:
 1
 2
```

```
unique(f, itr)
```

Returns an array containing one value from `itr` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `itr`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4
```

```
unique(A::AbstractArray; dims::Int)
```

Return unique regions of `A` along dimension `dims`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = map(isodd, reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2)))
2×2×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0

[:, :, 2] =
 1  1
 0  0

julia> unique(A)
2-element Vector{Bool}:
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=2)
2×1×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1
 0

[:, :, 2] =
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=3)
2×2×1 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0
```
```
unique!(f, A::AbstractVector)
```

Selects one value from `A` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `A`, then return the modified A.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method is available as of Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4

julia> unique!(n -> n%3, [5, 1, 8, 9, 3, 4, 10, 7, 2, 6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 1
 9

julia> unique!(iseven, [2, 3, 5, 7, 9])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```

```
unique!(A::AbstractVector)
```

Remove duplicate items as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), then return the modified `A`. `unique!` will return the elements of `A` in the order that they occur. If you do not care about the order of the returned data, then calling `(sort!(A); unique!(A))` will be much more efficient as long as the elements of `A` can be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!([1, 1, 1])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

julia> A = [7, 3, 2, 3, 7, 5];

julia> unique!(A)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 7
 3
 2
 5

julia> B = [7, 6, 42, 6, 7, 42];

julia> sort!(B);  # unique! is able to process sorted data much more efficiently.

julia> unique!(B)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  6
  7
 42
```
```
unlock(lock)
```

Releases ownership of the `lock`.

If this is a recursive lock which has been acquired before, decrement an internal counter and return immediately.
```
unmark(s::IO)
```

Remove a mark from stream `s`. Return `true` if the stream was marked, `false` otherwise.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers `dest` and `src` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source array to a destination, starting at offset `so` in the source and `do` in the destination (1-indexed).

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed to ensure that N is inbounds on either array. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, i::Integer=1)
```

Load a value of type `T` from the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1]`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may segfault your program or return garbage answers, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_pointer_to_objref(p::Ptr)
```

Convert a `Ptr` to an object reference. Assumes the pointer refers to a valid heap-allocated Julia object. If this is not the case, undefined behavior results, hence this function is considered "unsafe" and should be used with care.

See also [`pointer_from_objref`](@ref).
```
unsafe_read(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from the `IO` stream object into `ref` (converted to a pointer).

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_read(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsafe_store!(p::Ptr{T}, x, i::Integer=1)
```

Store a value of type `T` to the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1] = x`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_string(p::Ptr{UInt8}, [length::Integer])
```

Copy a string from the address of a C-style (NUL-terminated) string encoded as UTF-8. (The pointer can be safely freed afterwards.) If `length` is specified (the length of the data in bytes), the string does not have to be NUL-terminated.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `p` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_trunc(T, x)
```

Return the nearest integral value of type `T` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`. If the value is not representable by `T`, an arbitrary value will be returned. See also [`trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, -2.2)
-2

julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, NaN)
-9223372036854775808
```
```
unsafe_wrap(Array, pointer::Ptr{T}, dims; own = false)
```

Wrap a Julia `Array` object around the data at the address given by `pointer`, without making a copy.  The pointer element type `T` determines the array element type. `dims` is either an integer (for a 1d array) or a tuple of the array dimensions. `own` optionally specifies whether Julia should take ownership of the memory, calling `free` on the pointer when the array is no longer referenced.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `pointer` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_write(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from `ref` (converted to a pointer) into the `IO` object.

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_write(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsigned(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the unsigned type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(Int16)
UInt16
julia> unsigned(UInt64)
UInt64
```

```
unsigned(x)
```

Convert a number to an unsigned integer. If the argument is signed, it is reinterpreted as unsigned without checking for negative values.

See also: [`signed`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(-2)
0xfffffffffffffffe

julia> unsigned(2)
0x0000000000000002

julia> signed(unsigned(-2))
-2
```
```
uperm(file)
```

Get the permissions of the owner of the file as a bitfield of

| Value | Description        |
|:----- |:------------------ |
| 01    | Execute Permission |
| 02    | Write Permission   |
| 04    | Read Permission    |

For allowed arguments, see [`stat`](@ref).
```
uppercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to uppercase.

See also [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercase("Julia")
"JULIA"
```
```
uppercasefirst(s::AbstractString) -> String
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to uppercase (technically "title case" for Unicode). See also [`titlecase`](@ref) to capitalize the first character of every word in `s`.

See also [`lowercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercasefirst("python")
"Python"
```
```
valtype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
valtype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the value type of an array. This is identical to `eltype` and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(["one", "two", "three"])
String
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
valtype(type)
```

Get the value type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
String
```
```
values(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values, return an iterator over the values. This function simply returns its argument by default, since the elements of a general iterator are normally considered its "values".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2);

julia> values(d)
ValueIterator for a Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  2
  1

julia> values([2])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
```

```
values(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all values in a collection. `collect(values(a))` returns an array of values. When the values are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(values(D))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```
```
vcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 1. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(vcat, x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3 4 5]
1×5 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4  5

julia> b = [6 7 8 9 10; 11 12 13 14 15]
2×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> vcat(a,b)
3×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  1   2   3   4   5
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> c = ([1 2 3], [4 5 6])
([1 2 3], [4 5 6])

julia> vcat(c...)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vs = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
 [5, 6]

julia> reduce(vcat, vs)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
vec(a::AbstractArray) -> AbstractVector
```

Reshape the array `a` as a one-dimensional column vector. Return `a` if it is already an `AbstractVector`. The resulting array shares the same underlying data as `a`, so it will only be mutable if `a` is mutable, in which case modifying one will also modify the other.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vec(a)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 2
 5
 3
 6

julia> vec(1:3)
1:3
```

See also [`reshape`](@ref), [`dropdims`](@ref).
```
view(A, inds...)
```

Like [`getindex`](@ref), but returns a lightweight array that lazily references (or is effectively a *view* into) the parent array `A` at the given index or indices `inds` instead of eagerly extracting elements or constructing a copied subset. Calling [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) on the returned value (often a [`SubArray`](@ref)) computes the indices to access or modify the parent array on the fly.  The behavior is undefined if the shape of the parent array is changed after `view` is called because there is no bound check for the parent array; e.g., it may cause a segmentation fault.

Some immutable parent arrays (like ranges) may choose to simply recompute a new array in some circumstances instead of returning a `SubArray` if doing so is efficient and provides compatible semantics.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    In Julia 1.6 or later, `view` can be called on an `AbstractString`, returning a `SubString`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = view(A, :, 1)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A # Note A has changed even though we modified b
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4

julia> view(2:5, 2:3) # returns a range as type is immutable
3:4
```
```
wait([x])
```

Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

  * [`Channel`](@ref): Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
  * [`Condition`](@ref): Wait for [`notify`](@ref) on a condition and return the `val` parameter passed to `notify`.
  * `Process`: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The `exitcode` field of a process can be used to determine success or failure.
  * [`Task`](@ref): Wait for a `Task` to finish. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.
  * [`RawFD`](@ref): Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see the `FileWatching` package).

If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. A task can only be restarted by an explicit call to [`schedule`](@ref) or [`yieldto`](@ref).

Often `wait` is called within a `while` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before proceeding.

Special note for [`Threads.Condition`](@ref):

The caller must be holding the [`lock`](@ref) that owns a `Threads.Condition` before calling this method. The calling task will be blocked until some other task wakes it, usually by calling [`notify`](@ref) on the same `Threads.Condition` object. The lock will be atomically released when blocking (even if it was locked recursively), and will be reacquired before returning.

```
wait(r::Future)
```

Wait for a value to become available for the specified [`Future`](@ref).

```
wait(r::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Wait for a value to become available on the specified [`RemoteChannel`](@ref).
```
walkdir(dir; topdown=true, follow_symlinks=false, onerror=throw)
```

Return an iterator that walks the directory tree of a directory. The iterator returns a tuple containing `(rootpath, dirs, files)`. The directory tree can be traversed top-down or bottom-up. If `walkdir` or `stat` encounters a `IOError` it will rethrow the error by default. A custom error handling function can be provided through `onerror` keyword argument. `onerror` is called with a `IOError` as argument.

# Examples

```julia
for (root, dirs, files) in walkdir(".")
    println("Directories in $root")
    for dir in dirs
        println(joinpath(root, dir)) # path to directories
    end
    println("Files in $root")
    for file in files
        println(joinpath(root, file)) # path to files
    end
end
```

```julia-repl
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> itr = walkdir("my");

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my", ["test"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test", ["dir"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test/dir", String[], String[])
```
```
which(f, types)
```

Returns the method of `f` (a `Method` object) that would be called for arguments of the given `types`.

If `types` is an abstract type, then the method that would be called by `invoke` is returned.

See also: [`parentmodule`](@ref), and `@which` and `@edit` in [`InteractiveUtils`](@ref man-interactive-utils).

```
which(types::Type{<:Tuple})
```

Returns the method that would be called by the given type signature (as a tuple type).

```
which(module, symbol)
```

Return the module in which the binding for the variable referenced by `symbol` in `module` was created.
```
widemul(x, y)
```

Multiply `x` and `y`, giving the result as a larger type.

See also [`promote`](@ref), [`Base.add_sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widemul(Float32(3.0), 4.0) isa BigFloat
true

julia> typemax(Int8) * typemax(Int8)
1

julia> widemul(typemax(Int8), typemax(Int8))  # == 127^2
16129
```
```
widen(x)
```

If `x` is a type, return a "larger" type, defined so that arithmetic operations `+` and `-` are guaranteed not to overflow nor lose precision for any combination of values that type `x` can hold.

For fixed-size integer types less than 128 bits, `widen` will return a type with twice the number of bits.

If `x` is a value, it is converted to `widen(typeof(x))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widen(Int32)
Int64

julia> widen(1.5f0)
1.5
```
```
withenv(f, kv::Pair...)
```

Execute `f` in an environment that is temporarily modified (not replaced as in `setenv`) by zero or more `"var"=>val` arguments `kv`. `withenv` is generally used via the `withenv(kv...) do ... end` syntax. A value of `nothing` can be used to temporarily unset an environment variable (if it is set). When `withenv` returns, the original environment has been restored.
```
write(io::IO, x)
write(filename::AbstractString, x)
```

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given I/O stream or file. Return the number of bytes written into the stream. See also [`print`](@ref) to write a text representation (with an encoding that may depend upon `io`).

The endianness of the written value depends on the endianness of the host system. Convert to/from a fixed endianness when writing/reading (e.g. using  [`htol`](@ref) and [`ltoh`](@ref)) to get results that are consistent across platforms.

You can write multiple values with the same `write` call. i.e. the following are equivalent:

```
write(io, x, y...)
write(io, x) + write(io, y...)
```

# Examples

Consistent serialization:

```jldoctest
julia> fname = tempname(); # random temporary filename

julia> open(fname,"w") do f
           # Make sure we write 64bit integer in little-endian byte order
           write(f,htol(Int64(42)))
       end
8

julia> open(fname,"r") do f
           # Convert back to host byte order and host integer type
           Int(ltoh(read(f,Int64)))
       end
42
```

Merging write calls:

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."

julia> write(io, "Sometimes those members") + write(io, " write documentation.")
44

julia> String(take!(io))
"Sometimes those members write documentation."
```

User-defined plain-data types without `write` methods can be written when wrapped in a `Ref`:

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct; x::Float64; end

julia> io = IOBuffer()
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=0, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> write(io, Ref(MyStruct(42.0)))
8

julia> seekstart(io); read!(io, Ref(MyStruct(NaN)))
Base.RefValue{MyStruct}(MyStruct(42.0))
```
```
xor(x, y)
⊻(x, y)
```

Bitwise exclusive or of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊻ b` is a synonym for `xor(a,b)`, and `⊻` can be typed by tab-completing `\xor` or `\veebar` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> xor(true, false)
true

julia> xor(true, true)
false

julia> xor(true, missing)
missing

julia> false ⊻ false
false

julia> [true; true; false] .⊻ [true; false; false]
3-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
```
```
yield()
```

Switch to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run. A task that calls this function is still runnable, and will be restarted immediately if there are no other runnable tasks.

```
yield(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

A fast, unfair-scheduling version of `schedule(t, arg); yield()` which immediately yields to `t` before calling the scheduler.
```
yieldto(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with no arguments. On subsequent switches, `arg` is returned from the task's last call to `yieldto`. This is a low-level call that only switches tasks, not considering states or scheduling in any way. Its use is discouraged.
```
zero(x)
zero(::Type)
```

Get the additive identity element for the type of `x` (`x` can also specify the type itself).

See also [`iszero`](@ref), [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zero(1)
0

julia> zero(big"2.0")
0.0

julia> zero(rand(2,2))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0
```
```
zeros([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
zeros([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all zeros with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`ones`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zeros(1)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0

julia> zeros(Int8, 2, 3)
2×3 Matrix{Int8}:
 0  0  0
 0  0  0
```
```
zip(iters...)
```

Run multiple iterators at the same time, until any of them is exhausted. The value type of the `zip` iterator is a tuple of values of its subiterators.

!!! note
    `zip` orders the calls to its subiterators in such a way that stateful iterators will not advance when another iterator finishes in the current iteration.


See also: [`enumerate`](@ref), [`splat`](@ref Base.splat).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:5
1:5

julia> b = ["e","d","b","c","a"]
5-element Vector{String}:
 "e"
 "d"
 "b"
 "c"
 "a"

julia> c = zip(a,b)
zip(1:5, ["e", "d", "b", "c", "a"])

julia> length(c)
5

julia> first(c)
(1, "e")
```
```
x | y
```

Bitwise or. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `false`.

See also: [`&`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`||`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 | 10
14

julia> 4 | 1
5

julia> true | missing
true

julia> false | missing
missing
```
```
|>(x, f)
```

Applies a function to the preceding argument. This allows for easy function chaining.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1:5;] |> (x->x.^2) |> sum |> inv
0.01818181818181818
```
```
~(x)
```

Bitwise not.

See also: [`!`](@ref), [`&`](@ref), [`|`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ~4
-5

julia> ~10
-11

julia> ~true
false
```
```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.

```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20

ck, allowing it to be elided by [`@inbounds`](@ref).

!!! note
    The function in which `@boundscheck` is written must be inlined into its caller in order for `@inbounds` to have effect.


# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> @inline function g(A, i)
           @boundscheck checkbounds(A, i)
           return "accessing ($A)[$i]"
       end;

julia> f1() = return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f2() = @inbounds return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f1()

```

!!! warning
    The `@boundscheck` annotation allows you, as a library writer, to opt-in to allowing *other code* to remove your bounds checks with [`@inbounds`](@ref). As noted there, the caller must verify—using information they can access—that their accesses are valid before using `@inbounds`. For indexing into your [`AbstractArray`](@ref) subclasses, for example, this involves checking the indices against its [`axes`](@ref). Therefore, `@boundscheck` annotations should only be added to a [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) implementation after you are certain its behavior is correct.

```
@ccall library.function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall $function_pointer(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
```

Call a function in a C-exported shared library, specified by `library.function_name`, where `library` is a string constant or literal. The library may be omitted, in which case the `function_name` is resolved in the current process. Alternatively, `@ccall` may also be used to call a function pointer `$function_pointer`, such as one returned by `dlsym`.

Each `argvalue` to `@ccall` is converted to the corresponding `argtype`, by automatic insertion of calls to `unsafe_convert(argtype, cconvert(argtype, argvalue))`. (See also the documentation for [`unsafe_convert`](@ref Base.unsafe_convert) and [`cconvert`](@ref Base.cconvert) for further details.) In most cases, this simply results in a call to `convert(argtype, argvalue)`.

# Examples

```
@ccall strlen(s::Cstring)::Csize_t
```

This calls the C standard library function:

```
size_t strlen(char *)
```

with a Julia variable named `s`. See also `ccall`.

Varargs are supported with the following convention:

```
@ccall printf("%s = %d"::Cstring ; "foo"::Cstring, foo::Cint)::Cint
```

The semicolon is used to separate required arguments (of which there must be at least one) from variadic arguments.

Example using an external library:

```
# C signature of g_uri_escape_string:
# char *g_uri_escape_string(const char *unescaped, const char *reserved_chars_allowed, gboolean allow_utf8);

const glib = "libglib-2.0"
@ccall glib.g_uri_escape_string(my_uri::Cstring, ":/"::Cstring, true::Cint)::Cstring
```

The string literal could also be used directly before the function name, if desired `"libglib-2.0".g_uri_escape_string(...`
```
@cfunction(callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> Ptr{Cvoid}
@cfunction($callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> CFunction
```

Generate a C-callable function pointer from the Julia function `callable` for the given type signature. To pass the return value to a `ccall`, use the argument type `Ptr{Cvoid}` in the signature.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression (although it can include a splat expression). And that these arguments will be evaluated in global scope during compile-time (not deferred until runtime). Adding a '$' in front of the function argument changes this to instead create a runtime closure over the local variable `callable` (this is not supported on all architectures).

See [manual section on ccall and cfunction usage](@ref Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
           return x + y
       end

julia> @cfunction(foo, Int, (Int, Int))
Ptr{Cvoid} @0x000000001b82fcd0
```
```
@cmd str
```

Similar to `cmd`, generate a `Cmd` from the `str` string which represents the shell command(s) to be executed. The [`Cmd`](@ref) object can be run as a process and can outlive the spawning julia process (see `Cmd` for more).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cm = @cmd " echo 1 "
`echo 1`

julia> run(cm)
1
Process(`echo 1`, ProcessExited(0))
```
```
@coalesce(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); missing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @coalesce a f(2) f(3) error("`a` is still missing")
1

julia> b = missing;

julia> b = @coalesce b f(2) f(3) error("`b` is still missing")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: `b` is still missing
[...]
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@deprecate old new [export_old=true]
```

Deprecate method `old` and specify the replacement call `new`. Prevent `@deprecate` from exporting `old` by setting `export_old` to `false`. `@deprecate` defines a new method with the same signature as `old`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    As of Julia 1.5, functions defined by `@deprecate` do not print warning when `julia` is run without the `--depwarn=yes` flag set, as the default value of `--depwarn` option is `no`.  The warnings are printed from tests run by `Pkg.test()`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x)
old (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x) false
old (generic function with 1 method)
```
# Documentation

Functions, methods and types can be documented by placing a string before the definition:

```
"""
# The Foo Function
`foo(x)`: Foo the living hell out of `x`.
"""
foo(x) = ...
```

The `@doc` macro can be used directly to both set and retrieve documentation / metadata. The macro has special parsing so that the documented object may occur on the next line:

```
@doc "blah"
function foo() ...
```

By default, documentation is written as Markdown, but any object can be used as the first argument.

## Documenting objects after they are defined

You can document an object after its definition by

```
@doc "foo" function_to_doc
@doc "bar" TypeToDoc
```

For macros, the syntax is `@doc "macro doc" :(@Module.macro)` or `@doc "macro doc" :(string_macro"")` for string macros. Without the quote `:()` the expansion of the macro will be documented.

## Retrieving Documentation

You can retrieve docs for functions, macros and other objects as follows:

```
@doc foo
@doc @time
@doc md""
```

## Functions & Methods

Placing documentation before a method definition (e.g. `function foo() ...` or `foo() = ...`) will cause that specific method to be documented, as opposed to the whole function. Method docs are concatenated together in the order they were defined to provide docs for the function.
```
@elapsed
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the number of seconds it took to execute as a floating-point number.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@elapsed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@elapsed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @elapsed sleep(0.3)
0.301391426
```
```
@enum EnumName[::BaseType] value1[=x] value2[=y]
```

Create an `Enum{BaseType}` subtype with name `EnumName` and enum member values of `value1` and `value2` with optional assigned values of `x` and `y`, respectively. `EnumName` can be used just like other types and enum member values as regular values, such as

# Examples

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> @enum Fruit apple=1 orange=2 kiwi=3

julia> f(x::Fruit) = "I'm a Fruit with value: $(Int(x))"
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(apple)
"I'm a Fruit with value: 1"

julia> Fruit(1)
apple::Fruit = 1
```

Values can also be specified inside a `begin` block, e.g.

```julia
@enum EnumName begin
    value1
    value2
end
```

`BaseType`, which defaults to [`Int32`](@ref), must be a primitive subtype of `Integer`. Member values can be converted between the enum type and `BaseType`. `read` and `write` perform these conversions automatically. In case the enum is created with a non-default `BaseType`, `Integer(value1)` will return the integer `value1` with the type `BaseType`.

To list all the instances of an enum use `instances`, e.g.

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> instances(Fruit)
(apple, orange, kiwi)
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@eval [mod,] ex
```

Evaluate an expression with values interpolated into it using `eval`. If two arguments are provided, the first is the module to evaluate in.
```
@evalpoly(z, c...)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k z^{k-1} c[k]$ for the coefficients `c[1]`, `c[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `z`.  This macro expands to efficient inline code that uses either Horner's method or, for complex `z`, a more efficient Goertzel-like algorithm.

See also [`evalpoly`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @evalpoly(3, 1, 0, 1)
10

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 0, 1)
5

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 1, 1)
7
```
```
@fastmath expr
```

Execute a transformed version of the expression, which calls functions that may violate strict IEEE semantics. This allows the fastest possible operation, but results are undefined – be careful when doing this, as it may change numerical results.

This sets the [LLVM Fast-Math flags](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags), and corresponds to the `-ffast-math` option in clang. See [the notes on performance annotations](@ref man-performance-annotations) for more details.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @fastmath 1+2
3

julia> @fastmath(sin(3))
0.1411200080598672
```
```
@generated f
```

`@generated` is used to annotate a function which will be generated. In the body of the generated function, only types of arguments can be read (not the values). The function returns a quoted expression evaluated when the function is called. The `@generated` macro should not be used on functions mutating the global scope or depending on mutable elements.

See [Metaprogramming](@ref) for further details.

## Example:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else
               return :(x)
           end
       end
bar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar(4)
16

julia> bar("baz")
"baz"
```
```
@gensym
```

Generates a gensym symbol for a variable. For example, `@gensym x y` is transformed into `x = gensym("x"); y = gensym("y")`.
```
@goto name
```

`@goto name` unconditionally jumps to the statement at the location [`@label name`](@ref).

`@label` and `@goto` cannot create jumps to different top-level statements. Attempts cause an error. To still use `@goto`, enclose the `@label` and `@goto` in a block.
```
@html_str -> Docs.HTML
```

Create an `HTML` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> html"Julia"
HTML{String}("Julia")
```
```
@inbounds(blk)
```

Eliminates array bounds checking within expressions.

In the example below the in-range check for referencing element `i` of array `A` is skipped to improve performance.

```julia
function sum(A::AbstractArray)
    r = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in eachindex(A)
        @inbounds r += A[i]
    end
    return r
end
```

!!! warning
    Using `@inbounds` may return incorrect results/crashes/corruption for out-of-bounds indices. The user is responsible for checking it manually. Only use `@inbounds` when it is certain from the information locally available that all accesses are in bounds.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@inline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that this function is worth inlining.

Small functions typically do not need the `@inline` annotation, as the compiler does it automatically. By using `@inline` on bigger functions, an extra nudge can be given to the compiler to inline it.

`@inline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@inline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@inline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @inline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@inline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that calls within `block` are worth inlining.

```julia
# The compiler will try to inline `f`
@inline f(...)

# The compiler will try to inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@inline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @noinline function explicit_noinline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @inline explicit_noinline(args...) # will be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @noinline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @inline f(a0)  # the compiler will try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)          # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! warning
    Although a callsite annotation will try to force inlining in regardless of the cost model, there are still chances it can't succeed in it. Especially, recursive calls can not be inlined even if they are annotated as `@inline`d.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.

@isdefined s -> Bool
```

Tests whether variable `s` is defined in the current scope.

See also [`isdefined`](@ref) for field properties and [`isassigned`](@ref) for array indexes or [`haskey`](@ref) for other mappings.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @isdefined newvar

julia> newvar = 1
1

julia> @isdefined newvar
true

julia> function f()
           println(@isdefined x)
           x = 3
           println(@isdefined x)
       end

```
@label name
```

Labels a statement with the symbolic label `name`. The label marks the end-point of an unconditional jump with [`@goto name`](@ref).
```
lazy"str"
```

Create a [`LazyString`](@ref) using regular string interpolation syntax. Note that interpolations are *evaluated* at LazyString construction time, but *printing* is delayed until the first access to the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    `lazy"str"` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

```
@lock l expr
```

Macro version of `lock(f, l::AbstractLock)` but with `expr` instead of `f` function. Expands to:

```julia
lock(l)
try
    expr
finally
    unlock(l)
end
```

This is similar to using [`lock`](@ref) with a `do` block, but avoids creating a closure and thus can improve the performance.
```
@macroexpand
```

Return equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded).

There are differences between `@macroexpand` and [`macroexpand`](@ref).

  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) takes a keyword argument `recursive`, `@macroexpand` is always recursive. For a non recursive macro version, see [`@macroexpand1`](@ref).
  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) has an explicit `module` argument, `@macroexpand` always expands with respect to the module in which it is called.

This is best seen in the following example:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m()
               1
           end
           function f()
               (@macroexpand(@m),
                macroexpand(M, :(@m)),
                macroexpand(Main, :(@m))
               )
           end
       end
M

julia> macro m()
           2
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> M.f()
(1, 1, 2)
```

With `@macroexpand` the expression expands where `@macroexpand` appears in the code (module `M` in the example). With `macroexpand` the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.
```
@macroexpand1
```

Non recursive version of [`@macroexpand`](@ref).
```
@noinline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline a function.

Small functions are typically inlined automatically. By using `@noinline` on small functions, auto-inlining can be prevented.

`@noinline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@noinline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@noinline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @noinline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@noinline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline the calls within `block`.

```julia
# The compiler will try to not inline `f`
@noinline f(...)

# The compiler will try to not inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@noinline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @inline function explicit_inline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @noinline explicit_inline(args...) # will not be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @inline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @noinline f(a0)  # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)            # the compiler will try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

!!! note
    If the function is trivial (for example returning a constant) it might get inlined anyway.

```
@nospecialize
```

Applied to a function argument name, hints to the compiler that the method should not be specialized for different types of that argument, but instead to use precisely the declared type for each argument. This is only a hint for avoiding excess code generation. Can be applied to an argument within a formal argument list, or in the function body. When applied to an argument, the macro must wrap the entire argument expression. When used in a function body, the macro must occur in statement position and before any code.

When used without arguments, it applies to all arguments of the parent scope. In local scope, this means all arguments of the containing function. In global (top-level) scope, this means all methods subsequently defined in the current module.

Specialization can reset back to the default by using [`@specialize`](@ref).

```julia
function example_function(@nospecialize x)
    ...
end

function example_function(x, @nospecialize(y = 1))
    ...
end

function example_function(x, y, z)
    @nospecialize x y
    ...
end

@nospecialize
f(y) = [x for x in y]
@specialize
```
```
@polly
```

Tells the compiler to apply the polyhedral optimizer Polly to a function.
```
@r_str -> Regex
```

Construct a regex, such as `r"^[a-z]*$"`, without interpolation and unescaping (except for quotation mark `"` which still has to be escaped). The regex also accepts one or more flags, listed after the ending quote, to change its behaviour:

  * `i` enables case-insensitive matching
  * `m` treats the `^` and `$` tokens as matching the start and end of individual lines, as opposed to the whole string.
  * `s` allows the `.` modifier to match newlines.
  * `x` enables "comment mode": whitespace is enabled except when escaped with `\`, and `#` is treated as starting a comment.
  * `a` disables `UCP` mode (enables ASCII mode). By default `\B`, `\b`, `\D`, `\d`, `\S`, `\s`, `\W`, `\w`, etc. match based on Unicode character properties. With this option, these sequences only match ASCII characters.

See [`Regex`](@ref) if interpolation is needed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"a+.*b+.*?d$"ism, "Goodbye,\nOh, angry,\nBad world\n")
RegexMatch("angry,\nBad world")
```

This regex has the first three flags enabled.
```
@raw_str -> String
```

Create a raw string without interpolation and unescaping. The exception is that quotation marks still must be escaped. Backslashes escape both quotation marks and other backslashes, but only when a sequence of backslashes precedes a quote character. Thus, 2n backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes and the end of the literal while 2n+1 backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes followed by a quote character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println(raw"\ $x")
\ $x

julia> println(raw"\"")
"

julia> println(raw"\\\"")
\"

julia> println(raw"\\x \\\"")
\\x \"
```
```
@s_str -> SubstitutionString
```

Construct a substitution string, used for regular expression substitutions.  Within the string, sequences of the form `\N` refer to the Nth capture group in the regex, and `\g<groupname>` refers to a named capture group with name `groupname`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> msg = "#Hello# from Julia";

julia> replace(msg, r"#(.+)# from (?<from>\w+)" => s"FROM: \g<from>; MESSAGE: \1")
"FROM: Julia; MESSAGE: Hello"
```
```
@show exs...
```

Prints one or more expressions, and their results, to `stdout`, and returns the last result.

See also: [`show`](@ref), [`@info`](@ref man-logging), [`println`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = @show 1+2
1 + 2 = 3
3

julia> @show x^2 x/2;
x ^ 2 = 9
x / 2 = 1.5
```
```
@showtime expr
```

Like `@time` but also prints the expression being evaluated for reference.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This macro was added in Julia 1.8.


See also [`@time`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @showtime sleep(1)
sleep(1): 1.002164 seconds (4 allocations: 128 bytes)
```
```
@simd
```

Annotate a `for` loop to allow the compiler to take extra liberties to allow loop re-ordering

!!! warning
    This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia. Incorrect use of the `@simd` macro may cause unexpected results.


The object iterated over in a `@simd for` loop should be a one-dimensional range. By using `@simd`, you are asserting several properties of the loop:

  * It is safe to execute iterations in arbitrary or overlapping order, with special consideration for reduction variables.
  * Floating-point operations on reduction variables can be reordered, possibly causing different results than without `@simd`.

In many cases, Julia is able to automatically vectorize inner for loops without the use of `@simd`. Using `@simd` gives the compiler a little extra leeway to make it possible in more situations. In either case, your inner loop should have the following properties to allow vectorization:

  * The loop must be an innermost loop
  * The loop body must be straight-line code. Therefore, [`@inbounds`](@ref) is   currently needed for all array accesses. The compiler can sometimes turn   short `&&`, `||`, and `?:` expressions into straight-line code if it is safe   to evaluate all operands unconditionally. Consider using the [`ifelse`](@ref)   function instead of `?:` in the loop if it is safe to do so.
  * Accesses must have a stride pattern and cannot be "gathers" (random-index   reads) or "scatters" (random-index writes).
  * The stride should be unit stride.

!!! note
    The `@simd` does not assert by default that the loop is completely free of loop-carried memory dependencies, which is an assumption that can easily be violated in generic code. If you are writing non-generic code, you can use `@simd ivdep for ... end` to also assert that:


  * There exists no loop-carried memory dependencies
  * No iteration ever waits on a previous iteration to make forward progress.
```
@something(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); nothing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @something a f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `a`")
1

julia> b = nothing;

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `b`")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: Unable to find default for `b`
[...]

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) Some(nothing)
f(2)
f(3)

julia> b === nothing
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@specialize
```

Reset the specialization hint for an argument back to the default. For details, see [`@nospecialize`](@ref).
```
@static
```

Partially evaluate an expression at parse time.

For example, `@static Sys.iswindows() ? foo : bar` will evaluate `Sys.iswindows()` and insert either `foo` or `bar` into the expression. This is useful in cases where a construct would be invalid on other platforms, such as a `ccall` to a non-existent function. `@static if Sys.isapple() foo end` and `@static foo <&&,||> bar` are also valid syntax.
```
@sync
```

Wait until all lexically-enclosed uses of `@async`, `@spawn`, `@spawnat` and `@distributed` are complete. All exceptions thrown by enclosed async operations are collected and thrown as a `CompositeException`.
```
@task
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) without executing it, and return the [`Task`](@ref). This only creates a task, and does not run it.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a1() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = @task a1();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
@text_str -> Docs.Text
```

Create a `Text` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> text"Julia"
Julia
```
```
@threadcall((cfunc, clib), rettype, (argtypes...), argvals...)
```

The `@threadcall` macro is called in the same way as [`ccall`](@ref) but does the work in a different thread. This is useful when you want to call a blocking C function without causing the main `julia` thread to become blocked. Concurrency is limited by size of the libuv thread pool, which defaults to 4 threads but can be increased by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable and restarting the `julia` process.

Note that the called function should never call back into Julia.
```
@time expr
@time "description" expr
```

A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations, and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression. Any time spent garbage collecting (gc), compiling new code, or recompiling invalidated code is shown as a percentage.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@time` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@time @eval ...`.

See also [`@showtime`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

!!! note
    For more serious benchmarking, consider the `@btime` macro from the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The option to add a description was introduced in Julia 1.8.

    Recompilation time being shown separately from compilation time was introduced in Julia 1.8


```julia-repl
julia> x = rand(10,10);

julia> @time x * x;
  0.606588 seconds (2.19 M allocations: 116.555 MiB, 3.75% gc time, 99.94% compilation time)

julia> @time x * x;

julia> @time "A one second sleep" sleep(1)
A one second sleep: 1.005750 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)

julia> for loop in 1:3
            @time loop sleep(1)
        end

2: 1.001263 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
3: 1.003676 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
```
```
@timed
```

A macro to execute an expression, and return the value of the expression, elapsed time, total bytes allocated, garbage collection time, and an object with various memory allocation counters.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@timed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@timed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> stats = @timed rand(10^6);

julia> stats.time
0.006634834

julia> stats.bytes

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The return type of this macro was changed from `Tuple` to `NamedTuple` in Julia 1.5.

```
@timev expr
@timev "description" expr
```

This is a verbose version of the `@time` macro. It first prints the same information as `@time`, then any non-zero memory allocation counters, and then returns the value of the expression.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

@uint128_str str
@uint128_str(str)
```

`@uint128_str` parses a string into a UInt128. Throws an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid integer.
```
@v_str
```

String macro used to parse a string to a [`VersionNumber`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v"1.2.3"
v"1.2.3"

julia> v"2.0.1-rc1"
v"2.0.1-rc1"
```
```
@view A[inds...]
```

Transform the indexing expression `A[inds...]` into the equivalent [`view`](@ref) call.

This can only be applied directly to a single indexing expression and is particularly helpful for expressions that include the special `begin` or `end` indexing syntaxes like `A[begin, 2:end-1]` (as those are not supported by the normal [`view`](@ref) function).

Note that `@view` cannot be used as the target of a regular assignment (e.g., `@view(A[1, 2:end]) = ...`), nor would the un-decorated [indexed assignment](@ref man-indexed-assignment) (`A[1, 2:end] = ...`) or broadcasted indexed assignment (`A[1, 2:end] .= ...`) make a copy.  It can be useful, however, for *updating* broadcasted assignments like `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .+= 1` because this is a simple syntax for `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .= @view(A[1, 2:end]) + 1`, and the indexing expression on the right-hand side would otherwise make a copy without the `@view`.

See also [`@views`](@ref) to switch an entire block of code to use views for non-scalar indexing.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = @view A[:, 1]
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4
```
```
@views expression
```

Convert every array-slicing operation in the given expression (which may be a `begin`/`end` block, loop, function, etc.) to return a view. Scalar indices, non-array types, and explicit [`getindex`](@ref) calls (as opposed to `array[...]`) are unaffected.

!!! note
    The `@views` macro only affects `array[...]` expressions that appear explicitly in the given `expression`, not array slicing that occurs in functions called by that code.


!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(3, 3);

julia> @views for row in 1:3
           b = A[row, :]
           b[:] .= row
       end

julia> A
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 3.0  3.0  3.0
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
PipeBuffer(data::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[]; maxsize::Integer = typemax(Int))
```

An [`IOBuffer`](@ref) that allows reading and performs writes by appending. Seeking and truncating are not supported. See [`IOBuffer`](@ref) for the available constructors. If `data` is given, creates a `PipeBuffer` to operate on a data vector, optionally specifying a size beyond which the underlying `Array` may not be grown.
```
\(x, y)
```

Left division operator: multiplication of `y` by the inverse of `x` on the left. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 \ 6
2.0

julia> inv(3) * 6
2.0

julia> A = [4 3; 2 1]; x = [5, 6];

julia> A \ x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0

julia> inv(A) * x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0
```

```
\(A, B)
```

Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices `A` and `B`, the result `X` is such that `A*X == B` when `A` is square. The solver that is used depends upon the structure of `A`.  If `A` is upper or lower triangular (or diagonal), no factorization of `A` is required and the system is solved with either forward or backward substitution. For non-triangular square matrices, an LU factorization is used.

For rectangular `A` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of `A` and a rank estimate of `A` based on the R factor.

When `A` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the `LDLt` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

See also: [`factorize`](@ref), [`pinv`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 0; 1 -2]; B = [32; -4];

julia> X = A \ B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 32.0
 18.0

julia> A * X == B
true
```

```
(\)(F::QRSparse, B::StridedVecOrMat)
```

Solve the least squares problem $\min\|Ax - b\|^2$ or the linear system of equations $Ax=b$ when `F` is the sparse QR factorization of $A$. A basic solution is returned when the problem is underdetermined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse([1,2,4], [1,1,1], [1.0,1.0,1.0], 4, 2)
4×2 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1.0   ⋅
 1.0   ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅
 1.0   ⋅

julia> qr(A)\fill(1.0, 4)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0
```
```
^(x, y)
```

Exponentiation operator. If `x` is a matrix, computes matrix exponentiation.

If `y` is an `Int` literal (e.g. `2` in `x^2` or `-3` in `x^-3`), the Julia code `x^y` is transformed by the compiler to `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y))`, to enable compile-time specialization on the value of the exponent. (As a default fallback we have `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y)) = ^(x,y)`, where usually `^ == Base.^` unless `^` has been defined in the calling namespace.) If `y` is a negative integer literal, then `Base.literal_pow` transforms the operation to `inv(x)^-y` by default, where `-y` is positive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3^5
243

julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 37   54
 81  118
```

```
^(s::Union{AbstractString,AbstractChar}, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a string or character `n` times. This can also be written as `repeat(s, n)`.

See also [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Test "^3
"Test Test Test "
```

```
^(s::Regex, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a regex `n` times.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> r"Test "^2
r"(?:Test ){2}"

julia> match(r"Test "^2, "Test Test ")
RegexMatch("Test Test ")
```

```

```
```
__precompile__(isprecompilable::Bool)
```

Specify whether the file calling this function is precompilable, defaulting to `true`. If a module or file is *not* safely precompilable, it should call `__precompile__(false)` in order to throw an error if Julia attempts to precompile it.
```
abs(x)
```

The absolute value of `x`.

When `abs` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when `abs` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when `x == typemin(typeof(x))`, `abs(x) == x < 0`, not `-x` as might be expected.

See also: [`abs2`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref).

# Examples

```
abspath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to an absolute path by joining them together and adding the current directory if necessary. Equivalent to `abspath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
accumulate(op, A; dims::Integer, [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` along the dimension `dims` of `A` (providing `dims` is optional for vectors). An initial value `init` may optionally be provided by a keyword argument. See also [`accumulate!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

For common operations there are specialized variants of `accumulate`, see [`cumsum`](@ref), [`cumprod`](@ref). For a lazy version, see [`Iterators.accumulate`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
accumulate!(op, B, A; [dims], [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` on `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. Providing `dims` is optional for vectors.  If the keyword argument `init` is given, its value is used to instantiate the accumulation.

```
acos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse cosine. Otherwise, the inverse cosine is determined by using [`log`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_1].

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse sine. Otherwise, the inverse sine is determined by using [`log`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_2].

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> asin(sin([0.5 0.1; -0.2 0.3]))
2×2 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
  0.5-4.16334e-17im  0.1-5.55112e-17im
 -0.2+9.71445e-17im  0.3-1.249e-16im
```
```
asind(x)
```

Compute the inverse sine of `x`, where the output is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
asinh(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of `x`.

```
asinh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_5].

[^AH16_5]: Mary Aprahamian and Nicholas J. Higham, "Matrix Inverse Trigonometric and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions: Theory and Algorithms", MIMS EPrint: 2016.4. [https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577)
```
asyncmap(f, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Uses multiple concurrent tasks to map `f` over a collection (or multiple equal length collections). For multiple collection arguments, `f` is applied elementwise.

`ntasks` specifies the number of tasks to run concurrently. Depending on the length of the collections, if `ntasks` is unspecified, up to 100 tasks will be used for concurrent mapping.

`ntasks` can also be specified as a zero-arg function. In this case, the number of tasks to run in parallel is checked before processing every element and a new task started if the value of `ntasks_func` is greater than the current number of tasks.

If `batch_size` is specified, the collection is processed in batch mode. `f` must then be a function that must accept a `Vector` of argument tuples and must return a vector of results. The input vector will have a length of `batch_size` or less.

The following examples highlight execution in different tasks by returning the `objectid` of the tasks in which the mapping function is executed.

First, with `ntasks` undefined, each element is processed in a different task.

```
julia> tskoid() = objectid(current_task());

julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x6e15e66c75c75853
 0x440f8819a1baa682
 0x9fb3eeadd0c83985
 0xebd3e35fe90d4050
 0x29efc93edce2b961

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)))
5
```

With `ntasks=2` all elements are processed in 2 tasks.

```
julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)))
2
```

With `batch_size` defined, the mapping function needs to be changed to accept an array of argument tuples and return an array of results. `map` is used in the modified mapping function to achieve this.

```
julia> batch_func(input) = map(x->string("args_tuple: ", x, ", element_val: ", x[1], ", task: ", tskoid()), input)
batch_func (generic function with 1 method)

julia> asyncmap(batch_func, 1:5; ntasks=2, batch_size=2)
5-element Array{String,1}:
 "args_tuple: (1,), element_val: 1, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (2,), element_val: 2, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (3,), element_val: 3, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (4,), element_val: 4, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (5,), element_val: 5, task: 9118321258196414413"
```

!!! note
    Currently, all tasks in Julia are executed in a single OS thread co-operatively. Consequently, `asyncmap` is beneficial only when the mapping function involves any I/O - disk, network, remote worker invocation, etc.

```
asyncmap!(f, results, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Like [`asyncmap`](@ref), but stores output in `results` rather than returning a collection.
```
atan(y)
atan(y, x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively.

For one argument, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (1, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

For two arguments, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (*x*, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. This corresponds to a standard [`atan2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function. Note that by convention `atan(0.0,x)` is defined as $\pi$ and `atan(-0.0,x)` is defined as $-\pi$ when `x < 0`.

```
atan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse tangent. Otherwise, the inverse tangent is determined by using [`log`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_3].

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> atan(tan([0.5 0.1; -0.2 0.3]))
2×2 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
  0.5+1.38778e-17im  0.1-2.77556e-17im
 -0.2+6.93889e-17im  0.3-4.16334e-17im
```
```
atand(y)
atand(y,x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively, where the output is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The one-argument method supports square matrix arguments as of Julia 1.7.

```
atanh(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
atanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_6].

[^AH16_6]: Mary Aprahamian and Nicholas J. Higham, "Matrix Inverse Trigonometric and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions: Theory and Algorithms", MIMS EPrint: 2016.4. [https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577)
```
atexit(f)
```

Register a zero-argument function `f()` to be called at process exit. `atexit()` hooks are called in last in first out (LIFO) order and run before object finalizers.

Exit hooks are allowed to call `exit(n)`, in which case Julia will exit with exit code `n` (instead of the original exit code). If more than one exit hook calls `exit(n)`, then Julia will exit with the exit code corresponding to the last called exit hook that calls `exit(n)`. (Because exit hooks are called in LIFO order, "last called" is equivalent to "first registered".)
```
atreplinit(f)
```

Register a one-argument function to be called before the REPL interface is initialized in interactive sessions; this is useful to customize the interface. The argument of `f` is the REPL object. This function should be called from within the `.julia/config/startup.jl` initialization file.
```
axes(A, d)
```

Return the valid range of indices for array `A` along dimension `d`.

See also [`size`](@ref), and the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A, 2)
Base.OneTo(6)
```

# Usage note

Each of the indices has to be an `AbstractUnitRange{<:Integer}`, but at the same time can be a type that uses custom indices. So, for example, if you need a subset, use generalized indexing constructs like `begin`/`end` or [`firstindex`](@ref)/[`lastindex`](@ref):

```julia
ix = axes(v, 1)
ix[2:end]          # will work for eg Vector, but may fail in general
ix[(begin+1):end]  # works for generalized indexes
```

```
axes(A)
```

Return the tuple of valid indices for array `A`.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A)
(Base.OneTo(5), Base.OneTo(6), Base.OneTo(7))
```
```
backtrace()
```

Get a backtrace object for the current program point.
```
basename(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the file name part of a path.

!!! note
    This function differs slightly from the Unix `basename` program, where trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `$ basename /foo/bar/` returns `bar`, whereas `basename` in Julia returns an empty string `""`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> basename("/home/myuser/example.jl")
"example.jl"

julia> basename("/home/myuser/")
""
```

See also [`dirname`](@ref).
```
big(T::Type)
```

Compute the type that represents the numeric type `T` with arbitrary precision. Equivalent to `typeof(big(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big(Rational)
Rational{BigInt}

julia> big(Float64)
BigFloat

julia> big(Complex{Int})
Complex{BigInt}
```

```
big(x)
```

Convert a number to a maximum precision representation (typically [`BigInt`](@ref) or `BigFloat`). See [`BigFloat`](@ref BigFloat(::Any, rounding::RoundingMode)) for information about some pitfalls with floating-point numbers.
```
bind(chnl::Channel, task::Task)
```

Associate the lifetime of `chnl` with a task. `Channel` `chnl` is automatically closed when the task terminates. Any uncaught exception in the task is propagated to all waiters on `chnl`.

The `chnl` object can be explicitly closed independent of task termination. Terminating tasks have no effect on already closed `Channel` objects.

When a channel is bound to multiple tasks, the first task to terminate will close the channel. When multiple channels are bound to the same task, termination of the task will close all of the bound channels.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:4);

julia> bind(c,task);

julia> for i in c
           @show i
       end;
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4

julia> isopen(c)
false
```

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async (put!(c, 1); error("foo"));

julia> bind(c, task);

julia> take!(c)
1

julia> put!(c, 1);
ERROR: TaskFailedException
Stacktrace:
[...]
    nested task error: foo
[...]
```

```
bind(socket::Union{TCPServer, UDPSocket, TCPSocket}, host::IPAddr, port::Integer; ipv6only=false, reuseaddr=false, kws...)
```

Bind `socket` to the given `host:port`. Note that `0.0.0.0` will listen on all devices.

  * The `ipv6only` parameter disables dual stack mode. If `ipv6only=true`, only an IPv6 stack is created.
  * If `reuseaddr=true`, multiple threads or processes can bind to the same address without error if they all set `reuseaddr=true`, but only the last to bind will receive any traffic.
```
binomial(n::Integer, k::Integer)
```

The *binomial coefficient* $\binom{n}{k}$, being the coefficient of the $k$th term in the polynomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$.

If $n$ is non-negative, then it is the number of ways to choose `k` out of `n` items:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}
$$

where $n!$ is the [`factorial`](@ref) function.

If $n$ is negative, then it is defined in terms of the identity

$$
\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{k-n-1}{k}
$$

See also [`factorial`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> binomial(5, 3)
10

julia> factorial(5) ÷ (factorial(5-3) * factorial(3))
10

julia> binomial(-5, 3)
-35
```

```
bitreverse(x)
```

Reverse the order of bits in integer `x`. `x` must have a fixed bit width, e.g. be an `Int16` or `Int32`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitreverse(0x8080808080808080)
0x0101010101010101

julia> reverse(bitstring(0xa06e)) == bitstring(bitreverse(0xa06e))
true
```
```
bitrotate(x::Base.BitInteger, k::Integer)
```

`bitrotate(x, k)` implements bitwise rotation. It returns the value of `x` with its bits rotated left `k` times. A negative value of `k` will rotate to the right instead.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


See also: [`<<`](@ref), [`circshift`](@ref), [`BitArray`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> bitrotate(UInt8(114), 2)
0xc9

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 2))
"11001001"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, -2))
"10011100"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 8))
"01110010"
```
```
bitstring(n)
```

A string giving the literal bit representation of a primitive type.

See also [`count_ones`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref), [`digits`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitstring(Int32(4))
"00000000000000000000000000000100"

julia> bitstring(2.2)
"0100000000000001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011010"
```
```
broadcast(f, As...)
```

Broadcast the function `f` over the arrays, tuples, collections, [`Ref`](@ref)s and/or scalars `As`.

Broadcasting applies the function `f` over the elements of the container arguments and the scalars themselves in `As`. Singleton and missing dimensions are expanded to match the extents of the other arguments by virtually repeating the value. By default, only a limited number of types are considered scalars, including `Number`s, `String`s, `Symbol`s, `Type`s, `Function`s and some common singletons like [`missing`](@ref) and [`nothing`](@ref). All other arguments are iterated over or indexed into elementwise.

The resulting container type is established by the following rules:

  * If all the arguments are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns an unwrapped scalar.
  * If at least one argument is a tuple and all others are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns a tuple.
  * All other combinations of arguments default to returning an `Array`, but custom container types can define their own implementation and promotion-like rules to customize the result when they appear as arguments.

A special syntax exists for broadcasting: `f.(args...)` is equivalent to `broadcast(f, args...)`, and nested `f.(g.(args...))` calls are fused into a single broadcast loop.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6; 7 8; 9 10]
5×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2
 3   4
 5   6
 7   8
 9  10

julia> broadcast(+, A, B)

 14  15

julia> parse.(Int, ["1", "2"])
2-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> abs.((1, -2))
(1, 2)

julia> broadcast(+, 1.0, (0, -2.0))
(1.0, -1.0)

julia> (+).([[0,2], [1,3]], Ref{Vector{Int}}([1,-1]))
2-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]

julia> string.(("one","two","three","four"), ": ", 1:4)
4-element Vector{String}:
 "one: 1"
 "two: 2"
 "three: 3"
 "four: 4"

```
```
broadcast!(f, dest, As...)
```

Like [`broadcast`](@ref), but store the result of `broadcast(f, As...)` in the `dest` array. Note that `dest` is only used to store the result, and does not supply arguments to `f` unless it is also listed in the `As`, as in `broadcast!(f, A, A, B)` to perform `A[:] = broadcast(f, A, B)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1.0; 0.0]; B = [0.0; 0.0];

julia> broadcast!(+, B, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0

julia> broadcast!(+, A, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0
```
```
bswap(n)
```

Reverse the byte order of `n`.

(See also [`ntoh`](@ref) and [`hton`](@ref) to convert between the current native byte order and big-endian order.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = bswap(0x10203040)
0x40302010

julia> bswap(a)
0x10203040

julia> string(1, base = 2)
"1"

julia> string(bswap(1), base = 2)
"100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```
```
bytes2hex(itr) -> String
bytes2hex(io::IO, itr)
```

Convert an iterator `itr` of bytes to its hexadecimal string representation, either returning a `String` via `bytes2hex(itr)` or writing the string to an `io` stream via `bytes2hex(io, itr)`.  The hexadecimal characters are all lowercase.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `bytes2hex` with arbitrary iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `bytes2hex`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> b = hex2bytes(a)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> bytes2hex(b)
"3039"
```
```
bytesavailable(io)
```

Return the number of bytes available for reading before a read from this stream or buffer will block.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> bytesavailable(io)
34
```
```
cat(A...; dims)
```

Concatenate the input arrays along the specified dimensions in the iterable `dims`. For dimensions not in `dims`, all input arrays should have the same size, which will also be the size of the output array along that dimension. For dimensions in `dims`, the size of the output array is the sum of the sizes of the input arrays along that dimension. If `dims` is a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows one to construct block diagonal matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example, `cat(matrices...; dims=(1,2))` builds a block diagonal matrix, i.e. a block matrix with `matrices[1]`, `matrices[2]`, ... as diagonal blocks and matching zero blocks away from the diagonal.

See also [`hcat`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`hvcat`](@ref), [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cat([1 2; 3 4], [pi, pi], fill(10, 2,3,1); dims=2)
2×6×1 Array{Float64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1.0  2.0  3.14159  10.0  10.0  10.0
 3.0  4.0  3.14159  10.0  10.0  10.0

julia> cat(true, trues(2,2), trues(4)', dims=(1,2))
4×7 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  0  0  0  0  0  0
 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  1  1  1  1
```
```
catch_backtrace()
```

Get the backtrace of the current exception, for use within `catch` blocks.
```
cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```
```
cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Set the current working directory.

See also: [`pwd`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref), [`mkpath`](@ref), [`mktempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"

julia> cd()

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```

```
cd(f::Function, dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Temporarily change the current working directory to `dir`, apply function `f` and finally return to the original directory.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd(readdir, "/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")
34-element Array{String,1}:
 ".circleci"
 ".freebsdci.sh"

```
```
ceil([T,] x)
ceil(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
ceil(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`ceil(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is greater than or equal to `x`.

`ceil(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
ceil(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` greater than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-09-01

julia> ceil(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:45:00

julia> ceil(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

```
ceil(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` up to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
3 weeks

julia> ceil(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> ceil(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Cvoid])
```

Obtain a pointer to a global variable in a C-exported shared library, specified exactly as in [`ccall`](@ref). Returns a `Ptr{Type}`, defaulting to `Ptr{Cvoid}` if no `Type` argument is supplied. The values can be read or written by [`unsafe_load`](@ref) or [`unsafe_store!`](@ref), respectively.
```
checkbounds(Bool, A, I...)
```

Return `true` if the specified indices `I` are in bounds for the given array `A`. Subtypes of `AbstractArray` should specialize this method if they need to provide custom bounds checking behaviors; however, in many cases one can rely on `A`'s indices and [`checkindex`](@ref).

See also [`checkindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = rand(3, 3);

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 2)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 3, 4)
false

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3, 2:4)
false
```

```
checkbounds(A, I...)
```

Throw an error if the specified indices `I` are not in bounds for the given array `A`.
```
checkindex(Bool, inds::AbstractUnitRange, index)
```

Return `true` if the given `index` is within the bounds of `inds`. Custom types that would like to behave as indices for all arrays can extend this method in order to provide a specialized bounds checking implementation.

See also [`checkbounds`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 8)
true

julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 21)
false
```
```
chmod(path::AbstractString, mode::Integer; recursive::Bool=false)
```

Change the permissions mode of `path` to `mode`. Only integer `mode`s (e.g. `0o777`) are currently supported. If `recursive=true` and the path is a directory all permissions in that directory will be recursively changed. Return `path`.

!!! note
    Prior to Julia 1.6, this did not correctly manipulate filesystem ACLs  on Windows, therefore it would only set read-only bits on files.  It  now is able to manipulate ACLs.

```
chomp(s::AbstractString) -> SubString
```

Remove a single trailing newline from a string.

See also [`chop`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chomp("Hello\n")
"Hello"
```
```
chop(s::AbstractString; head::Integer = 0, tail::Integer = 1)
```

Remove the first `head` and the last `tail` characters from `s`. The call `chop(s)` removes the last character from `s`. If it is requested to remove more characters than `length(s)` then an empty string is returned.

See also [`chomp`](@ref), [`startswith`](@ref), [`first`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "March"
"March"

julia> chop(a)
"Marc"

julia> chop(a, head = 1, tail = 2)
"ar"

julia> chop(a, head = 5, tail = 5)
""
```
```
chopprefix(s::AbstractString, prefix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the prefix `prefix` from `s`. If `s` does not start with `prefix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopsuffix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "Ham")
"burger"

julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chopsuffix(s::AbstractString, suffix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the suffix `suffix` from `s`. If `s` does not end with `suffix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopprefix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "er")
"Hamburg"

julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chown(path::AbstractString, owner::Integer, group::Integer=-1)
```

Change the owner and/or group of `path` to `owner` and/or `group`. If the value entered for `owner` or `group` is `-1` the corresponding ID will not change. Only integer `owner`s and `group`s are currently supported. Return `path`.
```
circcopy!(dest, src)
```

Copy `src` to `dest`, indexing each dimension modulo its length. `src` and `dest` must have the same size, but can be offset in their indices; any offset results in a (circular) wraparound. If the arrays have overlapping indices, then on the domain of the overlap `dest` agrees with `src`.

See also: [`circshift`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> src = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> dest = OffsetArray{Int}(undef, (0:3,2:5))

julia> circcopy!(dest, src)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices 0:3×2:5:
 8  12  16  4

 6  10  14  2
 7  11  15  3

julia> dest[1:3,2:4] == src[1:3,2:4]
true
```
```
circshift(A, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in an array. The second argument is a tuple or vector giving the amount to shift in each dimension, or an integer to shift only in the first dimension.

See also: [`circshift!`](@ref), [`circcopy!`](@ref), [`bitrotate`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

# Examples

```
circshift!(dest, src, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in `src`, storing the result in `dest`. `shifts` specifies the amount to shift in each dimension.

The `dest` array must be distinct from the `src` array (they cannot alias each other).

clamp(x, lo, hi)
```

Return `x` if `lo <= x <= hi`. If `x > hi`, return `hi`. If `x < lo`, return `lo`. Arguments are promoted to a common type.

See also [`clamp!`](@ref), [`min`](@ref), [`max`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"

```

Restrict values in `array` to the specified range, in-place. See also [`clamp`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    `missing` entries in `array` require at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```
```
cld(x, y)
```

Smallest integer larger than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundUp)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`fld`](@ref).

# Examples

```
```
close(stream)
```

Close an I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first.

```
close(c::Channel[, excp::Exception])
```

Close a channel. An exception (optionally given by `excp`), is thrown by:

  * [`put!`](@ref) on a closed channel.
  * [`take!`](@ref) and [`fetch`](@ref) on an empty, closed channel.
```
closewrite(stream)
```

Shutdown the write half of a full-duplex I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first. Notify the other end that no more data will be written to the underlying file. This is not supported by all IO types.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = Base.BufferStream(); # this never blocks, so we can read and write on the same Task

julia> write(io, "request");

julia> # calling `read(io)` here would block forever

julia> closewrite(io);

julia> read(io, String)
"request"
```
```
cmp(x,y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. Uses the total order implemented by `isless`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp(1, 2)
-1

julia> cmp(2, 1)
1

julia> cmp(2+im, 3-im)
ERROR: MethodError: no method matching isless(::Complex{Int64}, ::Complex{Int64})
[...]
```

```
cmp(<, x, y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. The first argument specifies a less-than comparison function to use.

```
cmp(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Compare two strings. Return `0` if both strings have the same length and the character at each index is the same in both strings. Return `-1` if `a` is a prefix of `b`, or if `a` comes before `b` in alphabetical order. Return `1` if `b` is a prefix of `a`, or if `b` comes before `a` in alphabetical order (technically, lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp("abc", "abc")
0

julia> cmp("ab", "abc")
-1

julia> cmp("abc", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("ab", "ac")
-1

julia> cmp("ac", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("α", "a")
1

julia> cmp("b", "β")
-1
```
```
coalesce(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`missing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise return `missing`.

See also [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref), [`@coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> coalesce(missing, 1)
1

julia> coalesce(1, missing)
1

julia> coalesce(nothing, 1)  # returns `nothing`

julia> coalesce(missing, missing)
missing
```
```
code_lowered(f, types; generated=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Return an array of the lowered forms (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

If `generated` is `false`, the returned `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to fallback implementations. An error is thrown if no fallback implementation exists. If `generated` is `true`, these `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to the method bodies yielded by expanding the generators.

The keyword `debuginfo` controls the amount of code metadata present in the output.

Note that an error will be thrown if `types` are not leaf types when `generated` is `true` and any of the corresponding methods are an `@generated` method.
```
code_typed(f, types; kw...)
```

Returns an array of type-inferred lowered form (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

# Keyword Arguments

  * `optimize=true`: controls whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied.
  * `debuginfo=:default`: controls the amount of code metadata present in the output,

possible options are `:source` or `:none`.

# Internal Keyword Arguments

This section should be considered internal, and is only for who understands Julia compiler internals.

  * `world=Base.get_world_counter()`: optional, controls the world age to use when looking up methods,

use current world age if not specified.

  * `interp=Core.Compiler.NativeInterpreter(world)`: optional, controls the interpreter to use,

use the native interpreter Julia uses if not specified.

# Example

One can put the argument types in a tuple to get the corresponding `code_typed`.

```julia
julia> code_typed(+, (Float64, Float64))
1-element Vector{Any}:
 CodeInfo(
1 ─ %1 = Base.add_float(x, y)::Float64
└──      return %1
) => Float64
```
```
codepoint(c::AbstractChar) -> Integer
```

Return the Unicode codepoint (an unsigned integer) corresponding to the character `c` (or throw an exception if `c` does not represent a valid character). For `Char`, this is a `UInt32` value, but `AbstractChar` types that represent only a subset of Unicode may return a different-sized integer (e.g. `UInt8`).
```
codeunit(s::AbstractString) -> Type{<:Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}}
```

Return the code unit type of the given string object. For ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8 encoded strings, this would be `UInt8`; for UCS-2 and UTF-16 it would be `UInt16`; for UTF-32 it would be `UInt32`. The code unit type need not be limited to these three types, but it's hard to think of widely used string encodings that don't use one of these units. `codeunit(s)` is the same as `typeof(codeunit(s,1))` when `s` is a non-empty string.

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref).

```
codeunit(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}
```

Return the code unit value in the string `s` at index `i`. Note that

```
codeunit(s, i) :: codeunit(s)
```

I.e. the value returned by `codeunit(s, i)` is of the type returned by `codeunit(s)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = codeunit("Hello", 2)
0x65

julia> typeof(a)
UInt8
```

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
codeunits(s::AbstractString)
```

Obtain a vector-like object containing the code units of a string. Returns a `CodeUnits` wrapper by default, but `codeunits` may optionally be defined for new string types if necessary.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> codeunits("Juλia")
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x4a
 0x75
 0xce
 0xbb
 0x69
 0x61
```
```
collect(element_type, collection)
```

Return an `Array` with the given element type of all items in a collection or iterable. The result has the same shape and number of dimensions as `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(Float64, 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 3.0
 5.0
```

```
collect(collection)
```

Return an `Array` of all items in a collection or iterator. For dictionaries, returns `Pair{KeyType, ValType}`. If the argument is array-like or is an iterator with the [`HasShape`](@ref IteratorSize) trait, the result will have the same shape and number of dimensions as the argument.

Used by comprehensions to turn a generator into an `Array`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(1:2:13)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
 11
 13

4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  9
 25
 49
```
```
complex(r, [i])
```

Convert real numbers or arrays to complex. `i` defaults to zero.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(7)
7 + 0im

julia> complex([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 2 + 0im
 3 + 0im
```

```
complex(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type which can represent a value of type `T` as a complex number. Equivalent to `typeof(complex(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(Complex{Int})
Complex{Int64}

julia> complex(Int)
Complex{Int64}
```
```
conj(z)
```

Compute the complex conjugate of a complex number `z`.

See also: [`angle`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj(1 + 3im)
1 - 3im
```

```
conj(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the complex conjugate of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `conj.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 0 - 2im
 3 - 4im

julia> conj(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Complex{Int64}, 0}:
2 + 1im
```
```
conj!(A)
```

Transform an array to its complex conjugate in-place.

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1-1im  2+1im
 2-2im  3-1im
```
```
contains(haystack::AbstractString, needle)
```

Return `true` if `haystack` contains `needle`. This is the same as `occursin(needle, haystack)`, but is provided for consistency with `startswith(haystack, needle)` and `endswith(haystack, needle)`.

See also [`occursin`](@ref), [`in`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", "Julia")
true

julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", 'a')
true

julia> contains("aba", r"a.a")
true

julia> contains("abba", r"a.a")
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `contains` function requires at least Julia 1.5.


```
contains(needle)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument contains `needle`, i.e. a function equivalent to `haystack -> contains(haystack, needle)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(contains)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
No documentation found.

Binding `contractuser` does not exist.
```
convert(T, x)
```

Convert `x` to a value of type `T`.

If `T` is an [`Integer`](@ref) type, an [`InexactError`](@ref) will be raised if `x` is not representable by `T`, for example if `x` is not integer-valued, or is outside the range supported by `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> convert(Int, 3.0)
3

julia> convert(Int, 3.5)
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(3.5)
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

If `T` is a [`AbstractFloat`](@ref) type, then it will return the closest value to `x` representable by `T`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1/3
0.3333333333333333

julia> convert(Float32, x)
0.33333334f0

julia> convert(BigFloat, x)
0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125
```

If `T` is a collection type and `x` a collection, the result of `convert(T, x)` may alias all or part of `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = Int[1, 2, 3];

julia> y = convert(Vector{Int}, x);

julia> y === x
true
```

See also: [`round`](@ref), [`trunc`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`reinterpret`](@ref).
```
copy(x)
```

Create a shallow copy of `x`: the outer structure is copied, but not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a new array with identically-same elements as the original.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copyto!`](@ref).

```
copy(A::Transpose)
copy(A::Adjoint)
```

Eagerly evaluate the lazy matrix transpose/adjoint. Note that the transposition is applied recursively to elements.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2im; -3im 4]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0+2im
 0-3im  4+0im

julia> T = transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im

julia> copy(T)
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im
```
```
copy!(dst, src) -> dst
```

In-place [`copy`](@ref) of `src` into `dst`, discarding any pre-existing elements in `dst`. If `dst` and `src` are of the same type, `dst == src` should hold after the call. If `dst` and `src` are multidimensional arrays, they must have equal [`axes`](@ref).

See also [`copyto!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 this method is available from the `Future` standard library as `Future.copy!`.

```
copysign(x, y) -> z
```

Return `z` which has the magnitude of `x` and the same sign as `y`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> copysign(1, -2)
-1

julia> copysign(-1, 2)
1
```
```
copyto!(dest, do, src, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from collection `src` starting at offset `so`, to array `dest` starting at offset `do`. Return `dest`.

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractArray, src) -> dest
```

Copy all elements from collection `src` to array `dest`, whose length must be greater than or equal to the length `n` of `src`. The first `n` elements of `dest` are overwritten, the other elements are left untouched.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copy`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1., 0., 3., 0., 5.];

julia> y = zeros(7);

julia> copyto!(y, x);

julia> y

 3.0
 0.0
 5.0
 0.0
 0.0
```

```
copyto!(dest, Rdest::CartesianIndices, src, Rsrc::CartesianIndices) -> dest
```

Copy the block of `src` in the range of `Rsrc` to the block of `dest` in the range of `Rdest`. The sizes of the two regions must match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(5, 5);

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> Ainds = CartesianIndices((2:3, 2:3));

julia> Binds = CartesianIndices(B);

julia> copyto!(A, Ainds, B, Binds)
5×5 Matrix{Float64}:

 0.0  1.0  2.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  3.0  4.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0
```

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractMatrix, src::UniformScaling)
```

Copies a [`UniformScaling`](@ref) onto a matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    In Julia 1.0 this method only supported a square destination matrix. Julia 1.1. added support for a rectangular matrix.

```
cos(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`cosd`], [`cospi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
cos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the cosine. Otherwise, the cosine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cos(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
cosc(x)
```

Compute $\cos(\pi x) / x - \sin(\pi x) / (\pi x^2)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$. This is the derivative of `sinc(x)`.
```
cosd(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
cosh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic cosine of `x`.

```
cosh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cosine of a square matrix `A`.
```
cospi(x)
```

Compute $\cos(\pi x)$ more accurately than `cos(pi*x)`, especially for large `x`.
```
cot(x)
```

Compute the cotangent of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```

```
coth(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cotangent of `x`.

```
coth(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cotangent of square matrix `A`.
```
count([f=identity,] itr; init=0) -> Integer
```

Count the number of elements in `itr` for which the function `f` returns `true`. If `f` is omitted, count the number of `true` elements in `itr` (which should be a collection of boolean values). `init` optionally specifies the value to start counting from and therefore also determines the output type.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


See also: [`any`](@ref), [`sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count(i->(4<=i<=6), [2,3,4,5,6])
3

julia> count([true, false, true, true])
3

julia> count(>(3), 1:7, init=0x03)
0x07
```

```
count(
    pattern::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return the number of matches for `pattern` in `string`. This is equivalent to calling `length(findall(pattern, string))` but more efficient.

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a character as the pattern requires at least Julia 1.7.


```
count([f=identity,] A::AbstractArray; dims=:)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the given dimensions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `dims` keyword was added in Julia 1.5.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 0
```
```
count!([f=identity,] r, A)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, writing the result into `r` in-place.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    inplace `count!` was added in Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count!(<=(2), [1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1

julia> count!(<=(2), [1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 0
```
```
count_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_ones(7)
3

julia> count_ones(Int32(-1))
32
```
```
count_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_zeros(Int32(2 ^ 16 - 1))
16

julia> count_zeros(-1)
0
```
```
countlines(io::IO; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
```

Read `io` until the end of the stream/file and count the number of lines. To specify a file pass the filename as the first argument. EOL markers other than `'\n'` are supported by passing them as the second argument.  The last non-empty line of `io` is counted even if it does not end with the EOL, matching the length returned by [`eachline`](@ref) and [`readlines`](@ref).

To count lines of a `String`, `countlines(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> eof(io) # counting lines moves the file pointer
true

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io, eol = '.')
1
```
```
cp(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, follow_symlinks::Bool=false)
```

Copy the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`.

If `follow_symlinks=false`, and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be created as a symbolic link. If `follow_symlinks=true` and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be a copy of the file or directory `src` refers to. Return `dst`.

!!! note
    The `cp` function is different from the `cp` command. The `cp` function always operates on the assumption that `dst` is a file, while the command does different things depending on whether `dst` is a directory or a file. Using `force=true` when `dst` is a directory will result in loss of all the contents present in the `dst` directory, and `dst` will become a file that has the contents of `src` instead.

```
csc(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
csc(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosecant of a square matrix `A`.
```
cscd(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
csch(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cosecant of `x`.

```
csch(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cosecant of square matrix `A`.
```
ctime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).ctime`.
```
cumprod(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product along the dimension `dim`. See also [`cumprod!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Int8[1 2 3; 4 5 6];

julia> cumprod(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2   3

julia> cumprod(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2    6
 4  20  120
```

```
cumprod(itr)
```

Cumulative product of an iterator.

See also [`cumprod!`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref), [`cumsum`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumprod` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumprod(fill(1//2, 3))
3-element Vector{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//2
 1//4
 1//8

julia> cumprod((1, 2, 1, 3, 1))
(1, 2, 2, 6, 6)

julia> cumprod("julia")
5-element Vector{String}:
 "j"
 "ju"
 "jul"
 "juli"
 "julia"
```
```
cumprod!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).

```
cumprod!(y::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)
```

Cumulative product of a vector `x`, storing the result in `y`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).
```
cumsum(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum along the dimension `dims`. See also [`cumsum!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> cumsum(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 5  7  9

julia> cumsum(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3   6
 4  9  15
```

!!! note
    The return array's `eltype` is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size  and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size. To preserve `eltype` of arrays with small signed or unsigned integer `accumulate(+, A)` should be used.

    ```jldoctest
    julia> cumsum(Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int64}:
     100
     128

    julia> accumulate(+,Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int8}:
      100
     -128
    ```

    In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is `Int64[100, 128]`. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in `Int8[100, -128]`.


```
cumsum(itr)
```

Cumulative sum of an iterator.

See also [`accumulate`](@ref) to apply functions other than `+`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumsum` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumsum(1:3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 6

julia> cumsum((true, false, true, false, true))
(1, 1, 2, 2, 3)

julia> cumsum(fill(1, 2) for i in 1:3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]
 [3, 3]
```
```
cumsum!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumsum`](@ref).
```
current_exceptions(task::Task=current_task(); [backtrace::Bool=true])
```

Get the stack of exceptions currently being handled. For nested catch blocks there may be more than one current exception in which case the most recently thrown exception is last in the stack. The stack is returned as an `ExceptionStack` which is an AbstractVector of named tuples `(exception,backtrace)`. If `backtrace` is false, the backtrace in each pair will be set to `nothing`.

Explicitly passing `task` will return the current exception stack on an arbitrary task. This is useful for inspecting tasks which have failed due to uncaught exceptions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function went by the experimental name `catch_stack()` in Julia 1.1–1.6, and had a plain Vector-of-tuples as a return type.

```
current_task()
```

Get the currently running [`Task`](@ref).
```
deepcopy(x)
```

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::IdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
```
deg2rad(x)
```

Convert `x` from degrees to radians.

See also: [`rad2deg`](@ref), [`sind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deg2rad(90)
1.5707963267948966
```
```
delete!(collection, key)
```

Delete the mapping for the given key in a collection, if any, and return the collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b")
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b") # d is left unchanged
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1
```
```
deleteat!(a::Vector, i::Integer)
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

See also: [`delete!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 2)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
deleteat!(a::Vector, inds)
```

Remove the items at the indices given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

`inds` can be either an iterator or a collection of sorted and unique integer indices, or a boolean vector of the same length as `a` with `true` indicating entries to delete.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5

Denominator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> denominator(2//3)
3

julia> denominator(4)
1
```
```
detach(command)
```

Mark a command object so that it will be run in a new process group, allowing it to outlive the julia process, and not have Ctrl-C interrupts passed to it.
```
diff(A::AbstractVector)
diff(A::AbstractArray; dims::Integer)
```

Finite difference operator on a vector or a multidimensional array `A`. In the latter case the dimension to operate on needs to be specified with the `dims` keyword argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `diff` for arrays with dimension higher than 2 requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [2 4; 6 16]

```
digits([T<:Integer], n::Integer; base::T = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Return an array with element type `T` (default `Int`) of the digits of `n` in the given base, optionally padded with zeros to a specified size. More significant digits are at higher indices, such that `n == sum(digits[k]*base^(k-1) for k=1:length(digits))`.

See also [`ndigits`](@ref), [`digits!`](@ref), and for base 2 also [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> n == evalpoly(13, digits(n, base = 13))
true
```
```
digits!(array, n::Integer; base::Integer = 10)
```

Fills an array of the digits of `n` in the given base. More significant digits are at higher indices. If the array length is insufficient, the least significant digits are filled up to the array length. If the array length is excessive, the excess portion is filled with zeros.

# Examples

```
dirname(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the directory part of a path. Trailing characters ('/' or '\') in the path are counted as part of the path.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dirname("/home/myuser")
"/home"

julia> dirname("/home/myuser/")
"/home/myuser"
```

See also [`basename`](@ref).
```
disable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Disable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function on the current task, for calling external code that may call julia code that is not interrupt safe. Intended to be called using `do` block syntax as follows:

```
disable_sigint() do
    # interrupt-unsafe code
    ...
end
```

This is not needed on worker threads (`Threads.threadid() != 1`) since the `InterruptException` will only be delivered to the master thread. External functions that do not call julia code or julia runtime automatically disable sigint during their execution.
```
diskstat(path=pwd())
```

Returns statistics in bytes about the disk that contains the file or directory pointed at by `path`. If no argument is passed, statistics about the disk that contains the current working directory are returned.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
display(x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
display(mime, x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

Display `x` using the topmost applicable display in the display stack, typically using the richest supported multimedia output for `x`, with plain-text [`stdout`](@ref) output as a fallback. The `display(d, x)` variant attempts to display `x` on the given display `d` only, throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if `d` cannot display objects of this type.

In general, you cannot assume that `display` output goes to `stdout` (unlike [`print(x)`](@ref) or [`show(x)`](@ref)).  For example, `display(x)` may open up a separate window with an image. `display(x)` means "show `x` in the best way you can for the current output device(s)." If you want REPL-like text output that is guaranteed to go to `stdout`, use [`show(stdout, "text/plain", x)`](@ref) instead.

There are also two variants with a `mime` argument (a MIME type string, such as `"image/png"`), which attempt to display `x` using the requested MIME type *only*, throwing a `MethodError` if this type is not supported by either the display(s) or by `x`. With these variants, one can also supply the "raw" data in the requested MIME type by passing `x::AbstractString` (for MIME types with text-based storage, such as text/html or application/postscript) or `x::Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types).

To customize how instances of a type are displayed, overload [`show`](@ref) rather than `display`, as explained in the manual section on [custom pretty-printing](@ref man-custom-pretty-printing).
```
displayable(mime) -> Bool
displayable(d::AbstractDisplay, mime) -> Bool
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given `mime` type (string) is displayable by any of the displays in the current display stack, or specifically by the display `d` in the second variant.
```
displaysize([io::IO]) -> (lines, columns)
```

Return the nominal size of the screen that may be used for rendering output to this `IO` object. If no input is provided, the environment variables `LINES` and `COLUMNS` are read. If those are not set, a default size of `(24, 80)` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> withenv("LINES" => 30, "COLUMNS" => 100) do
           displaysize()
       end
(30, 100)
```

To get your TTY size,

```julia-repl
julia> displaysize(stdout)
(34, 147)
```
```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

# Examples:

```
```
divrem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient and remainder from Euclidean division. Equivalent to `(div(x,y,r), rem(x,y,r))`. Equivalently, with the default value of `r`, this call is equivalent to `(x÷y, x%y)`.

See also: [`fldmod`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref).

```
download(url::AbstractString, [path::AbstractString = tempname()]) -> path
```

Download a file from the given url, saving it to the location `path`, or if not specified, a temporary path. Returns the path of the downloaded file.

!!! note
    Since Julia 1.6, this function is deprecated and is just a thin wrapper around `Downloads.download`. In new code, you should use that function directly instead of calling this.

```
dropdims(A; dims)
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with the dimensions specified by `dims` removed. `size(A,d)` must equal 1 for every `d` in `dims`, and repeated dimensions or numbers outside `1:ndims(A)` are forbidden.

The result shares the same underlying data as `A`, such that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

See also: [`reshape`](@ref), [`vec`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

```
```
dump(x; maxdepth=8)
```

Show every part of the representation of a value. The depth of the output is truncated at `maxdepth`.

eachindex(A...)
```

Create an iterable object for visiting each index of an `AbstractArray` `A` in an efficient manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, return a specialized Cartesian range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, return an iterator object supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

If you supply more than one `AbstractArray` argument, `eachindex` will create an iterable object that is fast for all arguments (a [`UnitRange`](@ref) if all inputs have fast linear indexing, a [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) otherwise). If the arrays have different sizes and/or dimensionalities, a `DimensionMismatch` exception will be thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> for i in eachindex(A) # linear indexing
           println(i)
       end

julia> for i in eachindex(view(A, 1:2, 1:1)) # Cartesian indexing

       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1)
CartesianIndex(2, 1)
```
```
eachline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
eachline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Create an iterable `EachLine` object that will yield each line from an I/O stream or a file. Iteration calls [`readline`](@ref) on the stream argument repeatedly with `keep` passed through, determining whether trailing end-of-line characters are retained. When called with a file name, the file is opened once at the beginning of iteration and closed at the end. If iteration is interrupted, the file will be closed when the `EachLine` object is garbage collected.

To iterate over each line of a `String`, `eachline(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

[`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) can be used on an `EachLine` object to read the lines in reverse order (for files, buffers, and other I/O streams supporting [`seek`](@ref)), and [`first`](@ref) or [`last`](@ref) can be used to extract the initial or final lines, respectively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> for line in eachline("my_file.txt")
           print(line)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members.

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Julia 1.8 is required to use `Iterators.reverse` or `last` with `eachline` iterators.

```
eachmatch(r::Regex, s::AbstractString; overlap::Bool=false)
```

Search for all matches of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return an iterator over the matches. If `overlap` is `true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from distinct character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a.a"
r"a.a"

julia> m = eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a")
Base.RegexMatchIterator(r"a.a", "a1a2a3a", false)

julia> collect(m)
2-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")

julia> collect(eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a", overlap = true))
3-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a2a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")
```
```
eachrow(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the first dimension of vector or matrix `A`, returning the rows as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
```
```
eachslice(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Create a generator that iterates over dimensions `dims` of `A`, returning views that select all the data from the other dimensions in `A`.

Only a single dimension in `dims` is currently supported. Equivalent to `(view(A,:,:,...,i,:,: ...)) for i in axes(A, dims))`, where `i` is in position `dims`.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref), [`eachcol`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), and [`selectdim`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```
```
eachsplit(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
eachsplit(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm` and return an iterator over the substrings.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`split`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `eachsplit` function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> collect(eachsplit(a, "."))
2-element Vector{SubString}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
eltype(type)
```

Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating a collection of the given `type`. For dictionary types, this will be a `Pair{KeyType,ValType}`. The definition `eltype(x) = eltype(typeof(x))` is provided for convenience so that instances can be passed instead of types. However the form that accepts a type argument should be defined for new types.

See also: [`keytype`](@ref), [`typeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eltype(fill(1f0, (2,2)))
Float32

julia> eltype(fill(0x1, (2,2)))
UInt8
```
```
empty(x::Tuple)
```

Returns an empty tuple, `()`.

```
empty(v::AbstractVector, [eltype])
```

Create an empty vector similar to `v`, optionally changing the `eltype`.

See also: [`empty!`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
Float64[]

julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], String)
String[]
```

```
empty(a::AbstractDict, [index_type=keytype(a)], [value_type=valtype(a)])
```

Create an empty `AbstractDict` container which can accept indices of type `index_type` and values of type `value_type`. The second and third arguments are optional and default to the input's `keytype` and `valtype`, respectively. (If only one of the two types is specified, it is assumed to be the `value_type`, and the `index_type` we default to `keytype(a)`).

Custom `AbstractDict` subtypes may choose which specific dictionary type is best suited to return for the given index and value types, by specializing on the three-argument signature. The default is to return an empty `Dict`.
```
empty!(collection) -> collection
```

Remove all elements from a `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> empty!(A);

julia> A
Dict{String, Int64}()
```
```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with `suffix`. If `suffix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the last character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`startswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("Sunday", "day")
true
```

```
endswith(suffix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument ends with `suffix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> endswith(y, suffix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(endswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `endswith(suffix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith_julia = endswith("Julia");

julia> endswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> endswith_julia("JuliaLang")
false
```

```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with the regex pattern, `suffix`.

!!! note
    `endswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"...$", s)` is faster than `endswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`startswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("JuliaLang", r"Lang|Roberts")
true
```
```
enumerate(iter)
```

An iterator that yields `(i, x)` where `i` is a counter starting at 1, and `x` is the `i`th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values `x` over which you are iterating, but also the number of iterations so far. Note that `i` may not be valid for indexing `iter`; it's also possible that `x != iter[i]`, if `iter` has indices that do not start at 1. See the `pairs(IndexLinear(), iter)` method if you want to ensure that `i` is an index.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
```
```
eof(stream) -> Bool
```

Test whether an I/O stream is at end-of-file. If the stream is not yet exhausted, this function will block to wait for more data if necessary, and then return `false`. Therefore it is always safe to read one byte after seeing `eof` return `false`. `eof` will return `false` as long as buffered data is still available, even if the remote end of a connection is closed.
```
eps(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractFloat
eps()
```

Return the *machine epsilon* of the floating point type `T` (`T = Float64` by default). This is defined as the gap between 1 and the next largest value representable by `typeof(one(T))`, and is equivalent to `eps(one(T))`.  (Since `eps(T)` is a bound on the *relative error* of `T`, it is a "dimensionless" quantity like [`one`](@ref).)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps()
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(Float32)
1.1920929f-7

julia> 1.0 + eps()
1.0000000000000002

julia> 1.0 + eps()/2
1.0
```

```
eps(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the *unit in last place* (ulp) of `x`. This is the distance between consecutive representable floating point values at `x`. In most cases, if the distance on either side of `x` is different, then the larger of the two is taken, that is

```
eps(x) == max(x-prevfloat(x), nextfloat(x)-x)
```

The exceptions to this rule are the smallest and largest finite values (e.g. `nextfloat(-Inf)` and `prevfloat(Inf)` for [`Float64`](@ref)), which round to the smaller of the values.

The rationale for this behavior is that `eps` bounds the floating point rounding error. Under the default `RoundNearest` rounding mode, if $y$ is a real number and $x$ is the nearest floating point number to $y$, then

$$
|y-x| \leq \operatorname{eps}(x)/2.
$$

See also: [`nextfloat`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref), [`floatmax`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(1.0)
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(prevfloat(2.0))
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(2.0)
4.440892098500626e-16

julia> x = prevfloat(Inf)      # largest finite Float64
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> x + eps(x)/2            # rounds up
Inf

julia> x + prevfloat(eps(x)/2) # rounds down
1.7976931348623157e308
```

```
eps(::Type{DateTime}) -> Millisecond
eps(::Type{Date}) -> Day
eps(::Type{Time}) -> Nanosecond
eps(::TimeType) -> Period
```

Return the smallest unit value supported by the `TimeType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(DateTime)
1 millisecond

julia> eps(Date)
1 day

julia> eps(Time)
1 nanosecond
```
```
error(message::AbstractString)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.

```
error(msg...)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.
```
errormonitor(t::Task)
```

Print an error log to `stderr` if task `t` fails.
```
esc(e)
```

Only valid in the context of an [`Expr`](@ref) returned from a macro. Prevents the macro hygiene pass from turning embedded variables into gensym variables. See the [Macros](@ref man-macros) section of the Metaprogramming chapter of the manual for more details and examples.
```
escape_string(str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::AbstractString
escape_string(io, str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::Nothing
```

General escaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`.

Backslashes (`\`) are escaped with a double-backslash (`"\\"`). Non-printable characters are escaped either with their standard C escape codes, `"\0"` for NUL (if unambiguous), unicode code point (`"\u"` prefix) or hex (`"\x"` prefix).

The optional `esc` argument specifies any additional characters that should also be escaped by a prepending backslash (`"` is also escaped by default in the first form).

The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which are to be kept as they are. Notice that `esc` has precedence here.

See also [`unescape_string`](@ref) for the reverse operation.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The `keep` argument is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb")
"aaa\\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb"; keep = '\n')
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("\xfe\xff") # invalid utf-8
"\\xfe\\xff"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0')) # unambiguous
"ℵ\\0"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0','0')) # \0 would be ambiguous
"ℵ\\x000"
```
```
evalfile(path::AbstractString, args::Vector{String}=String[])
```

Load the file using [`include`](@ref), evaluate all expressions, and return the value of the last one.
```
evalpoly(x, p)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k x^{k-1} p[k]$ for the coefficients `p[1]`, `p[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `x`. Loops are unrolled at compile time if the number of coefficients is statically known, i.e. when `p` is a `Tuple`. This function generates efficient code using Horner's method if `x` is real, or using a Goertzel-like [^DK62] algorithm if `x` is complex.

exp(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix exponential of `A`, defined by

$$
e^A = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^n}{n!}.
$$

For symmetric or Hermitian `A`, an eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, otherwise the scaling and squaring algorithm (see [^H05]) is chosen.

expanduser(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

On Unix systems, replace a tilde character at the start of a path with the current user's home directory.
```
expm1(x)
```

Accurately compute $e^x-1$. It avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small values of x.

extrema(itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` element in a single pass, and return them as a 2-tuple.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). As a consequence, when `itr` is empty the returned `(mn, mx)` tuple will satisfy `mn ≥ mx`. When `init` is specified it may be used even for non-empty `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

julia> extrema([]; init = (Inf, -Inf))
(Inf, -Inf)
```

```
extrema(f, itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` of `f` applied to each element in `itr` and return them as a 2-tuple. Only one pass is made over `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). It is used for non-empty collections. Note: it implies that, for empty `itr`, the returned value `(mn, mx)` satisfies `mn ≥ mx` even though for non-empty `itr` it  satisfies `mn ≤ mx`.  This is a "paradoxical" but yet expected result.

factorial(n::Integer)
```

Factorial of `n`. If `n` is an [`Integer`](@ref), the factorial is computed as an integer (promoted to at least 64 bits). Note that this may overflow if `n` is not small, but you can use `factorial(big(n))` to compute the result exactly in arbitrary precision.

fd(stream)
```

Return the file descriptor backing the stream or file. Note that this function only applies to synchronous `File`'s and `IOStream`'s not to any of the asynchronous streams.
```
fdio([name::AbstractString, ]fd::Integer[, own::Bool=false]) -> IOStream
```

Create an [`IOStream`](@ref) object from an integer file descriptor. If `own` is `true`, closing this object will close the underlying descriptor. By default, an `IOStream` is closed when it is garbage collected. `name` allows you to associate the descriptor with a named file.
```
fetch(c::Channel)
```

Wait for and get the first available item from the channel. Does not remove the item. `fetch` is unsupported on an unbuffered (0-size) channel.

```
fetch(t::Task)
```

Wait for a Task to finish, then return its result value. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.

```
fetch(x::Future)
```

Wait for and get the value of a [`Future`](@ref). The fetched value is cached locally. Further calls to `fetch` on the same reference return the cached value. If the remote value is an exception, throws a [`RemoteException`](@ref) which captures the remote exception and backtrace.

```
fetch(c::RemoteChannel)
```

Wait for and get a value from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). Exceptions raised are the same as for a [`Future`](@ref). Does not remove the item fetched.
```
fieldcount(t::Type)
```

Get the number of fields that an instance of the given type would have. An error is thrown if the type is too abstract to determine this.
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> fieldtypes(Foo)
(Int64, String)
```
```
filemode(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mode`.
```
filesize(path...)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).size`.
```
fill(value, dims::Tuple)
fill(value, dims...)
```

Create an array of size `dims` with every location set to `value`.

For example, `fill(1.0, (5,5))` returns a 5×5 array of floats, with `1.0` in every location of the array.

The dimension lengths `dims` may be specified as either a tuple or a sequence of arguments. An `N`-length tuple or `N` arguments following the `value` specify an `N`-dimensional array. Thus, a common idiom for creating a zero-dimensional array with its only location set to `x` is `fill(x)`.

Every location of the returned array is set to (and is thus [`===`](@ref) to) the `value` that was passed; this means that if the `value` is itself modified, all elements of the `fill`ed array will reflect that modification because they're *still* that very `value`. This is of no concern with `fill(1.0, (5,5))` as the `value` `1.0` is immutable and cannot itself be modified, but can be unexpected with mutable values like — most commonly — arrays.  For example, `fill([], 3)` places *the very same* empty array in all three locations of the returned vector:

```jldoctest
julia> v = fill([], 3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v[1] === v[2] === v[3]
true

julia> value = v[1]
Any[]

julia> push!(value, 867_5309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
```

To create an array of many independent inner arrays, use a [comprehension](@ref man-comprehensions) instead. This creates a new and distinct array on each iteration of the loop:

```jldoctest
julia> v2 = [[] for _ in 1:3]
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v2[1] === v2[2] === v2[3]
false

julia> push!(v2[1], 8675309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v2
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 []
 []
```

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fill(1.0, (2,3))
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia> fill(42)
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
42

julia> A = fill(zeros(2), 2) # sets both elements to the same [0.0, 0.0] vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [0.0, 0.0]
 [0.0, 0.0]

julia> A[1][1] = 42; # modifies the filled value to be [42.0, 0.0]

julia> A # both A[1] and A[2] are the very same vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [42.0, 0.0]
 [42.0, 0.0]
```
```
fill!(A, x)
```

Fill array `A` with the value `x`. If `x` is an object reference, all elements will refer to the same object. `fill!(A, Foo())` will return `A` filled with the result of evaluating `Foo()` once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,3)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia> fill!(A, 2.)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0

julia> a = [1, 1, 1]; A = fill!(Vector{Vector{Int}}(undef, 3), a); a[1] = 2; A
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:

3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 1
```
```
filter(f, a)
```

Return a copy of collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Support for `a` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.4.


See also: [`filter!`](@ref), [`Iterators.filter`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:10
1:10

julia> filter(isodd, a)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Return a copy of `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b")
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  2 => "b"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 1 entry:
  1 => "a"
```

```
filter(f, itr::SkipMissing{<:AbstractArray})
```

Return a vector similar to the array wrapped by the given `SkipMissing` iterator but with all missing elements and those for which `f` returns `false` removed.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1 2; missing 4]
2×2 Matrix{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1         2
  missing  4

julia> filter(isodd, skipmissing(x))
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```
```
filter!(f, a)
```

Update collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> filter!(isodd, Vector(1:10))
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter!(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Update `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b", 3=>"c")
Dict{Int64, String} with 3 entries:
  2 => "b"
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter!(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"
```
```
finalize(x)
```

Immediately run finalizers registered for object `x`.
```
finalizer(f, x)
```

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to `x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the behavior of this function is unpredictable.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`. Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or `ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

# Examples

```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing $x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

# Example

```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing $t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```
```
findall(f::Function, A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the indices or keys of `A` where `f(A[I])` returns `true`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

  :C => 0

julia> findall(x -> x >= 0, d)
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :A
 :C

```

```
findall(A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the `true` indices or keys of `A`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
findall(
    pattern::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return a `Vector{UnitRange{Int}}` of all the matches for `pattern` in `string`. Each element of the returned vector is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, like the return value of [`findnext`](@ref).

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> findall("a", "apple")
1-element Vector{UnitRange{Int64}}:

```
findfirst(A)
```

Return the index or key of the first `true` value in `A`. Return `nothing` if no such value is found. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
findnext(pattern::AbstractString, string::AbstractString, start::Integer)
findnext(pattern::AbstractPattern, string::String, start::Integer)
```

Find the next occurrence of `pattern` in `string` starting at position `start`. `pattern` can be either a string, or a regular expression, in which case `string` must be of type `String`.

The return value is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, such that `s[findnext(x, s, i)] == x`:

`findnext("substring", string, i)` == `start:stop` such that `string[start:stop] == "substring"` and `i <= start`, or `nothing` if unmatched.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> findnext("z", "Hello to the world", 1) === nothing
true

julia> findnext("o", "Hello to the world", 6)
8:8

julia> findnext("Lang", "JuliaLang", 2)
6:9
```

```
findnext(ch::AbstractChar, string::AbstractString, start::Integer)

```
firstindex(collection) -> Integer
firstindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the first index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the first index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[begin]` and `A[1, begin]` lower to `A[firstindex(A)]` and `A[1, firstindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`first`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> firstindex([1,2,4])
1

julia> firstindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
1
```
```
fld(x, y)
```

Largest integer less than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundDown)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fld(7.3,5.5)
1.0

julia> fld.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -2  -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

Because `fld(x, y)` implements strictly correct floored rounding based on the true value of floating-point numbers, unintuitive situations can arise. For example:

```jldoctest
julia> fld(6.0,0.1)
59.0
julia> 6.0/0.1
60.0
julia> 6.0/big(0.1)
59.99999999999999666933092612453056361837965690217069245739573412231113406246995
```

What is happening here is that the true value of the floating-point number written as `0.1` is slightly larger than the numerical value 1/10 while `6.0` represents the number 6 precisely. Therefore the true value of `6.0 / 0.1` is slightly less than 60. When doing division, this is rounded to precisely `60.0`, but `fld(6.0, 0.1)` always takes the floor of the true value, so the result is `59.0`.
```
fld1(x, y)
```

Flooring division, returning a value consistent with `mod1(x,y)`

See also [`mod1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> fld1(x, y)
4

julia> x == fld(x, y) * y + mod(x, y)
true

julia> x == (fld1(x, y) - 1) * y + mod1(x, y)
true
```
```
fldmod(x, y)
```

The floored quotient and modulus after division. A convenience wrapper for `divrem(x, y, RoundDown)`. Equivalent to `(fld(x,y), mod(x,y))`.

See also: [`fld`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).
```
fldmod1(x, y)
```

Return `(fld1(x,y), mod1(x,y))`.

See also [`fld1`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref).
```
flipsign(x, y)
```

Return `x` with its sign flipped if `y` is negative. For example `abs(x) = flipsign(x,x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> flipsign(5, 3)
5

julia> flipsign(5, -3)
-5
```
```
float(x)
```

Convert a number or array to a floating point data type.

See also: [`complex`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`convert`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(1:1000)
1.0:1.0:1000.0

julia> float(typemax(Int32))
2.147483647e9
```

```
float(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type to represent a value of type `T` as a floating point value. Equivalent to `typeof(float(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(Complex{Int})
ComplexF64 (alias for Complex{Float64})

julia> float(Int)
Float64
```
```
floatmax(T = Float64)
```

Return the largest finite number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

See also: [`typemax`](@ref), [`floatmin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmax(Float16)
Float16(6.55e4)

julia> floatmax(Float32)
3.4028235f38

julia> floatmax()
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf
```
```
floatmin(T = Float64)
```

Return the smallest positive normal number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmin(Float16)
Float16(6.104e-5)

julia> floatmin(Float32)
1.1754944f-38

julia> floatmin()
2.2250738585072014e-308
```
```
floor([T,] x)
floor(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
floor(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`floor(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is less than or equal to `x`.

`floor(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
floor(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` down to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> floor(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
30 minutes

julia> floor(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
1 day
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.

```
floor(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` less than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> floor(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> floor(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-06T00:00:00
```
```
flush(stream)
```

Commit all currently buffered writes to the given stream.
```
fma(x, y, z)
```

Computes `x*y+z` without rounding the intermediate result `x*y`. On some systems this is significantly more expensive than `x*y+z`. `fma` is used to improve accuracy in certain algorithms. See [`muladd`](@ref).
```
foldl(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

See also [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`foldr`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldl(=>, 1:4)
((1 => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> foldl(=>, 1:4; init=0)
(((0 => 1) => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> accumulate(=>, (1,2,3,4))
(1, 1 => 2, (1 => 2) => 3, ((1 => 2) => 3) => 4)
```
```
foldr(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldr(=>, 1:4)
1 => (2 => (3 => 4))

julia> foldr(=>, 1:4; init=0)
1 => (2 => (3 => (4 => 0)))
```
```
foreach(f, c...) -> Nothing
```

Call function `f` on each element of iterable `c`. For multiple iterable arguments, `f` is called elementwise, and iteration stops when any iterator is finished.

`foreach` should be used instead of [`map`](@ref) when the results of `f` are not needed, for example in `foreach(println, array)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri = 1:3:7; res = Int[];

julia> foreach(x -> push!(res, x^2), tri)

julia> res
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
 16
 49

julia> foreach((x, y) -> println(x, " with ", y), tri, 'a':'z')
1 with a
4 with b
7 with c
```
```
frexp(val)
```

Return `(x,exp)` such that `x` has a magnitude in the interval $[1/2, 1)$ or 0, and `val` is equal to $x \times 2^{exp}$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> frexp(12.8)
(0.8, 4)
```
```
fullname(m::Module)
```

Get the fully-qualified name of a module as a tuple of symbols. For example,

# Examples

julia> fullname(Base.Iterators)
(:Base, :Iterators)

julia> fullname(Main)
(:Main,)
```
```
functionloc(m::Method)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a `Method` definition.

```
functionloc(f::Function, types)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a generic `Function` definition.
```
gcd(x, y...)
```

Greatest common (positive) divisor (or zero if all arguments are zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcd(6, 9)
3

julia> gcd(6, -9)
3

julia> gcd(6, 0)
6

julia> gcd(0, 0)
0

julia> gcd(1//3, 2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, -2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, 2)
1//3

julia> gcd(0, 0, 10, 15)
5
```
```
gcdx(a, b)
```

Computes the greatest common (positive) divisor of `a` and `b` and their Bézout coefficients, i.e. the integer coefficients `u` and `v` that satisfy $ua+vb = d = gcd(a, b)$. $gcdx(a, b)$ returns $(d, u, v)$.

The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcdx(12, 42)
(6, -3, 1)

julia> gcdx(240, 46)
(2, -9, 47)
```

!!! note
    Bézout coefficients are *not* uniquely defined. `gcdx` returns the minimal Bézout coefficients that are computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. (Ref: D. Knuth, TAoCP, 2/e, p. 325, Algorithm X.) For signed integers, these coefficients `u` and `v` are minimal in the sense that $|u| < |y/d|$ and $|v| < |x/d|$. Furthermore, the signs of `u` and `v` are chosen so that `d` is positive. For unsigned integers, the coefficients `u` and `v` might be near their `typemax`, and the identity then holds only via the unsigned integers' modulo arithmetic.

```
gensym([tag])
```

Generates a symbol which will not conflict with other variable names.
```
get(collection, key, default)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or the given default value if no mapping for the key is present.

Get the local machine's host name.
```
getindex(type[, elements...])
```

Construct a 1-d array of the specified type. This is usually called with the syntax `Type[]`. Element values can be specified using `Type[a,b,c,...]`.

```

```
getindex(collection, key...)
```

Retrieve the value(s) stored at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...]` is converted by the compiler to `getindex(a, i, j, ...)`.

julia> struct MyType
           x
       end

julia> function Base.getproperty(obj::MyType, sym::Symbol)

```
hash(x[, h::UInt]) -> UInt
```

Compute an integer hash code such that `isequal(x,y)` implies `hash(x)==hash(y)`. The optional second argument `h` is a hash code to be mixed with the result.

New types should implement the 2-argument form, typically by calling the 2-argument `hash` method recursively in order to mix hashes of the contents with each other (and with `h`). Typically, any type that implements `hash` should also implement its own [`==`](@ref) (hence [`isequal`](@ref)) to guarantee the property mentioned above. Types supporting subtraction (operator `-`) should also implement [`widen`](@ref), which is required to hash values inside heterogeneous arrays.

See also: [`objectid`](@ref), [`Dict`](@ref), [`Set`](@ref).
```
haskey(collection, key) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection has a mapping for a given `key`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> haskey(D, 'a')
true

julia> haskey(D, 'c')
false
```
```
hasmethod(f, t::Type{<:Tuple}[, kwnames]; world=get_world_counter()) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching the given `Tuple` of argument types with the upper bound of world age given by `world`.

If a tuple of keyword argument names `kwnames` is provided, this also checks whether the method of `f` matching `t` has the given keyword argument names. If the matching method accepts a variable number of keyword arguments, e.g. with `kwargs...`, any names given in `kwnames` are considered valid. Otherwise the provided names must be a subset of the method's keyword arguments.

See also [`applicable`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Providing keyword argument names requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> hasmethod(length, Tuple{Array})
true

julia> f(; oranges=0) = oranges;

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:oranges,))
true

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:apples, :bananas))
false

julia> g(; xs...) = 4;

julia> hasmethod(g, Tuple{}, (:a, :b, :c, :d))  # g accepts arbitrary kwargs
true
```
```
hasproperty(x, s::Symbol)
```

Return a boolean indicating whether the object `x` has `s` as one of its own properties.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.2.


See also: [`propertynames`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).
```
hcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 2. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(hcat, x)`.

# Examples

julia> a = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

```
hex2bytes(itr)
```

Given an iterable `itr` of ASCII codes for a sequence of hexadecimal digits, returns a `Vector{UInt8}` of bytes  corresponding to the binary representation: each successive pair of hexadecimal digits in `itr` gives the value of one byte in the return vector.

The length of `itr` must be even, and the returned array has half of the length of `itr`. See also [`hex2bytes!`](@ref) for an in-place version, and [`bytes2hex`](@ref) for the inverse.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `hex2bytes` with iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `hex2bytes`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> hex2bytes(s)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> a = b"01abEF"
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x30
 0x31
 0x61
 0x62
 0x45
 0x46

julia> hex2bytes(a)
3-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0xab
 0xef
```
```
hex2bytes!(dest::AbstractVector{UInt8}, itr)
```

Convert an iterable `itr` of bytes representing a hexadecimal string to its binary representation, similar to [`hex2bytes`](@ref) except that the output is written in-place to `dest`. The length of `dest` must be half the length of `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling hex2bytes! with iterators producing UInt8 requires version 1.7. In earlier versions, you can collect the iterable before calling instead.

```
homedir() -> String
```

Return the current user's home directory.

!!! note
    `homedir` determines the home directory via `libuv`'s `uv_os_homedir`. For details (for example on how to specify the home directory via environment variables), see the [`uv_os_homedir` documentation](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/misc.html#c.uv_os_homedir).

```
htol(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Little-endian.
```
hton(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Network byte order (big-endian).
```
hvcat(rows::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, values...)
```

Horizontal and vertical concatenation in one call. This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument specifies the number of arguments to concatenate in each block row.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c; d e f]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> hvcat((3,3), a,b,c,d,e,f)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> [a b; c d; e f]
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6

julia> hvcat((2,2,2), a,b,c,d,e,f)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6
```

If the first argument is a single integer `n`, then all block rows are assumed to have `n` block columns.
```
hvncat(dim::Int, row_first, values...)
hvncat(dims::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, row_first, values...)
hvncat(shape::Tuple{Vararg{Tuple}}, row_first, values...)
```

Horizontal, vertical, and n-dimensional concatenation of many `values` in one call.

This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument either specifies the shape of the concatenation, similar to `hvcat`, as a tuple of tuples, or the dimensions that specify the key number of elements along each axis, and is used to determine the output dimensions. The `dims` form is more performant, and is used by default when the concatenation operation has the same number of elements along each axis (e.g., [a b; c d;;; e f ; g h]). The `shape` form is used when the number of elements along each axis is unbalanced (e.g., [a b ; c]). Unbalanced syntax needs additional validation overhead. The `dim` form is an optimization for concatenation along just one dimension. `row_first` indicates how `values` are ordered. The meaning of the first and second elements of `shape` are also swapped based on `row_first`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c;;; d e f]
1×3×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =

hypot(x, y)
```

Compute the hypotenuse $\sqrt{|x|^2+|y|^2}$ avoiding overflow and underflow.

This code is an implementation of the algorithm described in: An Improved Algorithm for `hypot(a,b)` by Carlos F. Borges The article is available online at ArXiv at the link   https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09481

```
hypot(x...)
```

Compute the hypotenuse $\sqrt{\sum |x_i|^2}$ avoiding overflow and underflow.

```
identity(x)
```

The identity function. Returns its argument.

See also: [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), and [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg)'s `I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> identity("Well, what did you expect?")
"Well, what did you expect?"
```
```
ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)
```

Return `x` if `condition` is `true`, otherwise return `y`. This differs from `?` or `if` in that it is an ordinary function, so all the arguments are evaluated first. In some cases, using `ifelse` instead of an `if` statement can eliminate the branch in generated code and provide higher performance in tight loops.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ifelse(1 > 2, 1, 2)
2
```
```
ignorestatus(command)
```

Mark a command object so that running it will not throw an error if the result code is non-zero.
```
imag(z)
```

Return the imaginary part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`conj`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag(1 + 3im)
3
```

```
imag(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the imaginary part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `imag.(A)`, except that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 2
 4

julia> imag(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
-1
```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

julia> 4 in a
true

julia> 5 in a
false

julia> missing in [1, 2]

```
include_dependency(path::AbstractString)
```

In a module, declare that the file specified by `path` (relative or absolute) is a dependency for precompilation; that is, the module will need to be recompiled if this file changes.

This is only needed if your module depends on a file that is not used via [`include`](@ref). It has no effect outside of compilation.
```
include_string([mapexpr::Function,] m::Module, code::AbstractString, filename::AbstractString="string")
```

Like [`include`](@ref), except reads code from the given string rather than from a file.

The optional first argument `mapexpr` can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression `expr` in `code`, the `include_string` function actually evaluates `mapexpr(expr)`.  If it is omitted, `mapexpr` defaults to [`identity`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Julia 1.5 is required for passing the `mapexpr` argument.

```
indexin(a, b)
```

Return an array containing the first index in `b` for each value in `a` that is a member of `b`. The output array contains `nothing` wherever `a` is not a member of `b`.

See also: [`sortperm`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'a'];

```
```
insert!(a::Vector, index::Integer, item)
```

Insert an `item` into `a` at the given `index`. `index` is the index of `item` in the resulting `a`.

See also: [`push!`](@ref), [`replace`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

 1
 2
  "here"
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
insorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given sorted collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values of the collection according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order, see [`sort`](@ref) for the keywords.

See also [`in`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> insorted(4, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # single match
true

julia> insorted(5, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # multiple matches
true

false

julia> insorted(0, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `insorted` was added in Julia 1.6.

```
instances(T::Type)
```

Return a collection of all instances of the given type, if applicable. Mostly used for enumerated types (see `@enum`).

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> @enum Color red blue green

julia> instances(Color)
(red, blue, green)
```
```
intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    As of Julia 1.8 intersect returns a result with the eltype of the type-promoted eltypes of the two inputs


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> intersect([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])
1-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> intersect(Set([1, 2]), BitSet([2, 3]), 1.0:10.0)
Set{Float64} with 1 element:
  2.0
```
```
intersect!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Intersect all passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.
```
inv(x)
```

Return the multiplicative inverse of `x`, such that `x*inv(x)` or `inv(x)*x` yields [`one(x)`](@ref) (the multiplicative identity) up to roundoff errors.

If `x` is a number, this is essentially the same as `one(x)/x`, but for some types `inv(x)` may be slightly more efficient.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> inv(2)
0.5

julia> inv(1 + 2im)
0.2 - 0.4im

julia> inv(1 + 2im) * (1 + 2im)
1.0 + 0.0im

julia> inv(2//3)
3//2
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `inv(::Missing)` requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
inv(M)
```

Matrix inverse. Computes matrix `N` such that `M * N = I`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Computed by solving the left-division `N = M \ I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> M = [2 5; 1 3]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  5
 1  3

julia> N = inv(M)
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  3.0  -5.0
 -1.0   2.0

julia> M*N == N*M == Matrix(I, 2, 2)
true
```
```
invmod(n, m)
```

Take the inverse of `n` modulo `m`: `y` such that $n y = 1 \pmod m$, and $div(y,m) = 0$. This will throw an error if $m = 0$, or if $gcd(n,m) \neq 1$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> invmod(2, 5)

julia> invmod(2, 3)
2

julia> invmod(5, 6)
5
```
No documentation found.

Binding `invokelatest` does not exist.
```
invperm(v)
```

Return the inverse permutation of `v`. If `B = A[v]`, then `A == B[invperm(v)]`.

See also [`sortperm`](@ref), [`invpermute!`](@ref), [`isperm`](@ref), [`permutedims`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> p = (2, 3, 1);

julia> invperm(p)

invpermute!(v, p)
```

Like [`permute!`](@ref), but the inverse of the given permutation is applied.

# Examples

```
isabspath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path is absolute (begins at the root directory).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabspath("/home")
true

julia> isabspath("home")
false
```
```
isabstracttype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as an abstract type (i.e. using the `abstract` keyword).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabstracttype(AbstractArray)
true

julia> isabstracttype(Vector)
false
```
```
isapprox(x, y; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : √eps, nans::Bool=false[, norm::Function])
```

Inexact equality comparison. Two numbers compare equal if their relative distance *or* their absolute distance is within tolerance bounds: `isapprox` returns `true` if `norm(x-y) <= max(atol, rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y)))`. The default `atol` is zero and the default `rtol` depends on the types of `x` and `y`. The keyword argument `nans` determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).

For real or complex floating-point values, if an `atol > 0` is not specified, `rtol` defaults to the square root of [`eps`](@ref) of the type of `x` or `y`, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significant digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an `atol > 0` is supplied, `rtol` defaults to zero.

The `norm` keyword defaults to `abs` for numeric `(x,y)` and to `LinearAlgebra.norm` for arrays (where an alternative `norm` choice is sometimes useful). When `x` and `y` are arrays, if `norm(x-y)` is not finite (i.e. `±Inf` or `NaN`), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of `x` and `y` are approximately equal component-wise.

The binary operator `≈` is equivalent to `isapprox` with the default arguments, and `x ≉ y` is equivalent to `!isapprox(x,y)`.

Note that `x ≈ 0` (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to `x == 0` since the default `atol` is `0`.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate `atol` (or use `norm(x) ≤ atol`) or rearrange your code (e.g. use `x ≈ y` rather than `x - y ≈ 0`).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero `atol` automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the "units") of your problem: for example, in `x - y ≈ 0`, `atol=1e-9` is an absurdly small tolerance if `x` is the [radius of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius) in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if `x` is the [radius of a Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) in meters.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Passing the `norm` keyword argument when comparing numeric (non-array) arguments requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; atol=0.05)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.34)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.33)
false

julia> 0.1 + 1e-10 ≈ 0.1
true

julia> 1e-10 ≈ 0
false

julia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)
true

julia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0]) # using `norm`
true
```

```
isapprox(x; kwargs...) / ≈(x; kwargs...)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using `≈`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y ≈ x`.

The keyword arguments supported here are the same as those in the 2-argument `isapprox`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This method requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
isascii(c::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character belongs to the ASCII character set, or whether this is true for all elements of a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isascii('a')
true

julia> isascii('α')
false

julia> isascii("abc")
true

julia> isascii("αβγ")
false
```

For example, `isascii` can be used as a predicate function for [`filter`](@ref) or [`replace`](@ref) to remove or replace non-ASCII characters, respectively:

```jldoctest
julia> filter(isascii, "abcdeγfgh") # discard non-ASCII chars
"abcdefgh"

julia> replace("abcdeγfgh", !isascii=>' ') # replace non-ASCII chars with spaces
"abcde fgh"
```
```
isassigned(array, i) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given array has a value associated with index `i`. Return `false` if the index is out of bounds, or has an undefined reference.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 5)
true

julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 3 * 3 + 1)
false

julia> mutable struct Foo end

julia> v = similar(rand(3), Foo)
3-element Vector{Foo}:
 #undef
 #undef
 #undef

julia> isassigned(v, 1)
false
```

```
isassigned(ref::RefValue) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given [`Ref`](@ref) is associated with a value. This is always true for a [`Ref`](@ref) of a bitstype object. Return `false` if the reference is undefined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ref = Ref{Function}()
Base.RefValue{Function}(#undef)

julia> isassigned(ref)
false

julia> ref[] = (foobar(x) = x)
foobar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> isassigned(ref)
true

julia> isassigned(Ref{Int}())
true
```
```
isbits(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is an instance of an [`isbitstype`](@ref) type.
```
isbitstype(T)
```

Return `true` if type `T` is a "plain data" type, meaning it is immutable and contains no references to other values, only `primitive` types and other `isbitstype` types. Typical examples are numeric types such as [`UInt8`](@ref), [`Float64`](@ref), and [`Complex{Float64}`](@ref). This category of types is significant since they are valid as type parameters, may not track [`isdefined`](@ref) / [`isassigned`](@ref) status, and have a defined layout that is compatible with C.

See also [`isbits`](@ref), [`isprimitivetype`](@ref), [`ismutable`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isbitstype(Complex{Float64})
true

julia> isbitstype(Complex)
false
```
```
isblockdev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a block device, `false` otherwise.
```
ischardev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a character device, `false` otherwise.
```
iscntrl(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool

julia> iscntrl('a')
false
```
```
isconcretetype(T)

Determine whether type `T` is a concrete type, meaning it could have direct instances (values `x` such that `typeof(x) === T`).

See also: [`isbits`](@ref), [`isabstracttype`](@ref), [`issingletontype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex{Float32}})

```
```
isdir(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a directory, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdir(homedir())

false
```

See also [`isfile`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isdirpath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path refers to a directory (for example, ends with a path separator).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdirpath("/home")
false

julia> isdirpath("/home/")
true
```
```
isdisjoint(a, b) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the collections `a` and `b` are disjoint. Equivalent to `isempty(a ∩ b)` but more efficient when possible.

See also: [`intersect`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdisjoint([1, 2], [2, 3, 4])
false

julia> isdisjoint([3, 1], [2, 4])
true
```
```
isdispatchtuple(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a tuple "leaf type", meaning it could appear as a type signature in dispatch and has no subtypes (or supertypes) which could appear in a call.
```
isempty(collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isempty([])
true

julia> isempty([1 2 3])
false
```

```
isempty(condition)
```

Return `true` if no tasks are waiting on the condition, `false` otherwise.
```
isequal(x, y)
```

Similar to [`==`](@ref), except for the treatment of floating point numbers and of missing values. `isequal` treats all floating-point `NaN` values as equal to each other, treats `-0.0` as unequal to `0.0`, and [`missing`](@ref) as equal to `missing`. Always returns a `Bool` value.

`isequal` is an equivalence relation - it is reflexive (`===` implies `isequal`), symmetric (`isequal(a, b)` implies `isequal(b, a)`) and transitive (`isequal(a, b)` and `isequal(b, c)` implies `isequal(a, c)`).

# Implementation

The default implementation of `isequal` calls `==`, so a type that does not involve floating-point values generally only needs to define `==`.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that types for which a custom `==` or `isequal` method exists must implement a corresponding [`hash`](@ref) method (and vice versa). Collections typically implement `isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

Furthermore, `isequal` is linked with [`isless`](@ref), and they work together to define a fixed total ordering, where exactly one of `isequal(x, y)`, `isless(x, y)`, or `isless(y, x)` must be `true` (and the other two `false`).

Scalar types generally do not need to implement `isequal` separate from `==`, unless they represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient implementation than that provided as a generic fallback (based on `isnan`, `signbit`, and `==`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isequal([1., NaN], [1., NaN])
true

julia> [1., NaN] == [1., NaN]
false

julia> 0.0 == -0.0
true

julia> isequal(0.0, -0.0)
false

julia> missing == missing
missing

julia> isequal(missing, missing)
true
```

```
isequal(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`isequal`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> isequal(y, x)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(isequal)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
```
iseven(x::Number) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `x` is an even integer (that is, an integer divisible by 2), and `false` otherwise.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Non-`Integer` arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iseven(9)
false

julia> iseven(10)
true
```
```
isfifo(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a FIFO, `false` otherwise.
```
isfile(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a regular file, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfile(homedir())
false

julia> f = open("test_file.txt", "w");

julia> isfile(f)
true

julia> close(f); rm("test_file.txt")
```

See also [`isdir`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isfinite(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is finite.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfinite(5)
true

julia> isfinite(NaN32)
false
```
```
isimmutable(v) -> Bool
```

!!! warning
    Consider using `!ismutable(v)` instead, as `isimmutable(v)` will be replaced by `!ismutable(v)` in a future release. (Since Julia 1.5)


Return `true` iff value `v` is immutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isimmutable(1)
true

julia> isimmutable([1,2])
false
```
```
isinf(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is infinite.

See also: [`Inf`](@ref), [`iszero`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).
```
isinteger(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` is numerically equal to some integer.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isinteger(4.0)
true
```
```
isinteractive() -> Bool
```

Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.
```
isless(t1::Tuple, t2::Tuple)
```

Returns true when t1 is less than t2 in lexicographic order.

```
isless(x, y)
```

Test whether `x` is less than `y`, according to a fixed total order (defined together with [`isequal`](@ref)). `isless` is not defined on all pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, if it is defined, it is expected to satisfy the following:

  * If `isless(x, y)` is defined, then so is `isless(y, x)` and `isequal(x, y)`, and exactly one of those three yields `true`.
  * The relation defined by `isless` is transitive, i.e., `isless(x, y) && isless(y, z)` implies `isless(x, z)`.

Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`, are ordered after regular values. [`missing`](@ref) values are ordered last.

This is the default comparison used by [`sort`](@ref).

# Implementation

Non-numeric types with a total order should implement this function. Numeric types only need to implement it if they have special values such as `NaN`. Types with a partial order should implement [`<`](@ref). See the documentation on [Alternate orderings](@ref) for how to define alternate ordering methods that can be used in sorting and related functions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless(1, 3)
true

julia> isless("Red", "Blue")
false
```

```
isless(A::AbstractVector, B::AbstractVector)
```

Returns true when `A` is less than `B` in lexicographic order.

```
isless(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether string `a` comes before string `b` in alphabetical order (technically, in lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless("a", "b")
true

julia> isless("β", "α")
false

julia> isless("a", "a")
false
```

```
```
islink(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a symbolic link, `false` otherwise.
```
islocked(lock) -> Status (Boolean)

```
ismount(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a mount point, `false` otherwise.
```
ismutable(v) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if and only if value `v` is mutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

true
```
```
isopen(object) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an object - such as a stream or timer – is not yet closed. Once an object is closed, it will never produce a new event. However, since a closed stream may still have data to read in its buffer, use [`eof`](@ref) to check for the ability to read data. Use the `FileWatching` package to be notified when a stream might be writable or readable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("my_file.txt", "w+");

julia> isopen(io)
true

julia> close(io)

julia> isopen(io)
false
```
```
ispath(path) -> Bool

```
isreadonly(io) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a stream is read-only.

# Examples

```jldoctest

julia> isreadonly(io)
true

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> isreadonly(io)
false
```
```
isready(c::Channel)
```

Determine whether a [`Channel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Returns immediately, does not block.

For unbuffered channels returns `true` if there are tasks waiting on a [`put!`](@ref).

```
isready(rr::Future)
```

Determine whether a [`Future`](@ref) has a value stored to it.

If the argument `Future` is owned by a different node, this call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for `rr` in a separate task instead or to use a local [`Channel`](@ref) as a proxy:

```julia
p = 1
f = Future(p)
errormonitor(@async put!(f, remotecall_fetch(long_computation, p)))
isready(f)  # will not block
```

```
isready(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Determine whether a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Note that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may no longer be true. However, it can be safely used on a [`Future`](@ref) since they are assigned only once.
```
isreal(x) -> Bool

true

julia> issorted([(1, "b"), (2, "a")], by = x -> x[1])

Determine whether a MIME type is text data. MIME types are assumed to be binary data except for a set of types known to be text data (possibly Unicode).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> istextmime(MIME("text/plain"))
true

julia> istextmime(MIME("image/png"))
false
```
```
isunordered(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is a value that is not orderable according to [`<`](@ref), such as `NaN` or `missing`.

The values that evaluate to `true` with this predicate may be orderable with respect to other orderings such as [`isless`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
isuppercase(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is an uppercase letter (according to the Unicode standard's `Uppercase` derived property).

See also [`islowercase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isuppercase('γ')
false

julia> isuppercase('Γ')
true

julia> isuppercase('❤')
false
```
```
isvalid(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Bool
```

Predicate indicating whether the given index is the start of the encoding of a character in `s` or not. If `isvalid(s, i)` is true then `s[i]` will return the character whose encoding starts at that index, if it's false, then `s[i]` will raise an invalid index error or a bounds error depending on if `i` is in bounds. In order for `isvalid(s, i)` to be an O(1) function, the encoding of `s` must be [self-synchronizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code). This is a basic assumption of Julia's generic string support.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`iterate`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref), [`length`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγdef";

julia> isvalid(str, 1)
true

julia> str[1]
'α': Unicode U+03B1 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> isvalid(str, 2)
false

julia> str[2]
ERROR: StringIndexError: invalid index [2], valid nearby indices [1]=>'α', [3]=>'β'
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
isvalid(value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for its type, which currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String` or `SubString{String}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char(0xd800))
false

julia> isvalid(SubString(String(UInt8[0xfe,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80]),1,2))
false

julia> isvalid(Char(0xd799))
true
```

```
isvalid(T, value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for that type. Types currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String`. Values for `AbstractChar` can be of type `AbstractChar` or [`UInt32`](@ref). Values for `String` can be of that type, `SubString{String}`, `Vector{UInt8}`, or a contiguous subarray thereof.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd800)
false

julia> isvalid(String, SubString("thisisvalid",1,5))
true

julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd799)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Support for subarray values was added in Julia 1.6.

```
iswritable(io) -> Bool
```

Return `false` if the specified IO object is not writable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           print(io, "Hello world!");
           iswritable(io)
       end
true

julia> open("myfile.txt", "r") do io
           iswritable(io)
       end
false

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isxdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character is a valid hexadecimal digit. Note that this does not include `x` (as in the standard `0x` prefix).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isxdigit('a')
true

julia> isxdigit('x')
false
```
```
iszero(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == zero(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether all of the elements of `x` are zero.

See also: [`isone`](@ref), [`isinteger`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iszero(0.0)
true

julia> iszero([1, 9, 0])
false

julia> iszero([false, 0, 0])
true
```
```
iterate(iter [, state]) -> Union{Nothing, Tuple{Any, Any}}
```

Advance the iterator to obtain the next element. If no elements remain, `nothing` should be returned. Otherwise, a 2-tuple of the next element and the new iteration state should be returned.

```
iterate(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{Tuple{<:AbstractChar, Int}, Nothing}
```

Return a tuple of the character in `s` at index `i` with the index of the start of the following character in `s`. This is the key method that allows strings to be iterated, yielding a sequences of characters. If `i` is out of bounds in `s` then a bounds error is raised. The `iterate` function, as part of the iteration protocol may assume that `i` is the start of a character in `s`.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
join([io::IO,] iterator [, delim [, last]])
```

Join any `iterator` into a single string, inserting the given delimiter (if any) between adjacent items.  If `last` is given, it will be used instead of `delim` between the last two items.  Each item of `iterator` is converted to a string via `print(io::IOBuffer, x)`. If `io` is given, the result is written to `io` rather than returned as a `String`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> join(["apples", "bananas", "pineapples"], ", ", " and ")
"apples, bananas and pineapples"

julia> join([1,2,3,4,5])
"12345"
```
```
joinpath(parts::AbstractString...) -> String
joinpath(parts::Vector{AbstractString}) -> String
joinpath(parts::Tuple{AbstractString}) -> String
```

Join path components into a full path. If some argument is an absolute path or (on Windows) has a drive specification that doesn't match the drive computed for the join of the preceding paths, then prior components are dropped.

Note on Windows since there is a current directory for each drive, `joinpath("c:", "foo")` represents a path relative to the current directory on drive "c:" so this is equal to "c:foo", not "c:\foo". Furthermore, `joinpath` treats this as a non-absolute path and ignores the drive letter casing, hence `joinpath("C:\A","c:b") = "C:\A\b"`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath("/home/myuser", "example.jl")
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath(["/home/myuser", "example.jl"])
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```
```
keepat!(a::Vector, inds)
keepat!(a::BitVector, inds)
```

Remove the items at all the indices which are not given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Items which are kept are shifted to fill the resulting gaps.

`inds` must be an iterator of sorted and unique integer indices. See also [`deleteat!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keepat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 2
```

```
keepat!(a::Vector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
keepat!(a::BitVector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
```

The in-place version of logical indexing `a = a[m]`. That is, `keepat!(a, m)` on vectors of equal length `a` and `m` will remove all elements from `a` for which `m` at the corresponding index is `false`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [:a, :b, :c];

julia> keepat!(a, [true, false, true])
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c

julia> a
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c
```
```
keys(a::AbstractArray)
```

Return an efficient array describing all valid indices for `a` arranged in the shape of `a` itself.

They keys of 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) are integers, whereas all other N-dimensional arrays use [`CartesianIndex`](@ref) to describe their locations.  Often the special array types [`LinearIndices`](@ref) and [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) are used to efficiently represent these arrays of integers and `CartesianIndex`es, respectively.

Note that the `keys` of an array might not be the most efficient index type; for maximum performance use  [`eachindex`](@ref) instead.

```
keys(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values (e.g. arrays and dictionaries), return an iterator over the keys.

```
keys(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all keys in a dictionary. `collect(keys(a))` returns an array of keys. When the keys are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(keys(D))
2-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

```
keys(m::RegexMatch) -> Vector
```

Return a vector of keys for all capture groups of the underlying regex. A key is included even if the capture group fails to match. That is, `idx` will be in the return value even if `m[idx] == nothing`.

Unnamed capture groups will have integer keys corresponding to their index. Named capture groups will have string keys.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method was added in Julia 1.6


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keys(match(r"(?<hour>\d+):(?<minute>\d+)(am|pm)?", "11:30"))
3-element Vector{Any}:
  "hour"
  "minute"
 3
```
```
keytype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
keytype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the key type of an array. This is equal to the `eltype` of the result of `keys(...)`, and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype([1, 2, 3]) == Int
true

julia> keytype([1 2; 3 4])
CartesianIndex{2}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
keytype(type)
```

Get the key type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
Int32
```
```
kill(p::Process, signum=Base.SIGTERM)
```

Send a signal to a process. The default is to terminate the process. Returns successfully if the process has already exited, but throws an error if killing the process failed for other reasons (e.g. insufficient permissions).

```
kill(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)
```

Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, by [`rmprocs`](@ref). It should cause the remote worker specified by `pid` to exit. `kill(manager::ClusterManager.....)` executes a remote `exit()` on `pid`.
```
kron(A, B)
```

Kronecker tensor product of two vectors or two matrices.

For real vectors `v` and `w`, the Kronecker product is related to the outer product by `kron(v,w) == vec(w * transpose(v))` or `w * transpose(v) == reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))`. Note how the ordering of `v` and `w` differs on the left and right of these expressions (due to column-major storage). For complex vectors, the outer product `w * v'` also differs by conjugation of `v`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> B = [im 1; 1 -im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im
 1+0im  0-1im

julia> kron(A, B)
4×4 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im  0+2im  2+0im
 1+0im  0-1im  2+0im  0-2im
 0+3im  3+0im  0+4im  4+0im
 3+0im  0-3im  4+0im  0-4im

julia> v = [1, 2]; w = [3, 4, 5];

julia> w*transpose(v)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10

julia> reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10
```
```
kron!(C, A, B)
```

`kron!` is the in-place version of [`kron`](@ref). Computes `kron(A, B)` and stores the result in `C` overwriting the existing value of `C`.

!!! tip
    Bounds checking can be disabled by [`@inbounds`](@ref), but you need to take care of the shape of `C`, `A`, `B` yourself.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
last(coll)
```

Get the last element of an ordered collection, if it can be computed in O(1) time. This is accomplished by calling [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last index. Return the end point of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) even if it is empty.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`endswith`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(1:2:10)
9

julia> last([1; 2; 3; 4])
4
```

```
last(itr, n::Integer)
```

Get the last `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(["foo", "bar", "qux"], 2)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "bar"
 "qux"

julia> last(1:6, 10)
1:6

julia> last(Float64[], 1)
Float64[]
```

```
last(s::AbstractString, n::Integer)
```

Get a string consisting of the last `n` characters of `s`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 0)
""

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 1)
"0"

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 3)
"²>0"
```
```
lastindex(collection) -> Integer
lastindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the last index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the last index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[end]` and `A[end, end]` lower to `A[lastindex(A)]` and `A[lastindex(A, 1), lastindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`axes`](@ref), [`firstindex`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lastindex([1,2,4])
3

julia> lastindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
4
```
```
lcm(x, y...)
```

Least common (positive) multiple (or zero if any argument is zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lcm(2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(-2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(0, 3)
0

julia> lcm(0, 0)
0

julia> lcm(1//3, 2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, -2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, 2)
2//1

julia> lcm(1, 3, 5, 7)

```
```
ldexp(x, n)
```

Compute $x \times 2^n$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ldexp(5., 2)
20.0
```
```
leading_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_ones(UInt32(2 ^ 32 - 2))
31
```
```
leading_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_zeros(Int32(1))
31
```
```
length(collection) -> Integer
```

Return the number of elements in the collection.

Use [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last valid index of an indexable collection.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length(1:5)
5

julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the number of elements in the array, defaults to `prod(size(A))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(s::AbstractString) -> Int
length(s::AbstractString, i::Integer, j::Integer) -> Int
```

Return the number of characters in string `s` from indices `i` through `j`.

This is computed as the number of code unit indices from `i` to `j` which are valid character indices. With only a single string argument, this computes the number of characters in the entire string. With `i` and `j` arguments it computes the number of indices between `i` and `j` inclusive that are valid indices in the string `s`. In addition to in-bounds values, `i` may take the out-of-bounds value `ncodeunits(s) + 1` and `j` may take the out-of-bounds value `0`.

!!! note
    The time complexity of this operation is linear in general. That is, it will take the time proportional to the number of bytes or characters in the string because it counts the value on the fly. This is in contrast to the method for arrays, which is a constant-time operation.


See also [`isvalid`](@ref), [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length("jμΛIα")
5
```
```
lock(lock)
```

Acquire the `lock` when it becomes available. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

Each `lock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).

```
lock(f::Function, lock)
```

Acquire the `lock`, execute `f` with the `lock` held, and release the `lock` when `f` returns. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

When this function returns, the `lock` has been released, so the caller should not attempt to `unlock` it.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a [`Channel`](@ref) as the second argument requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
log(b,x)
```

Compute the base `b` logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(4,8)
1.5

julia> log(4,2)
0.5

julia> log(-2, 3)

```

!!! note
    If `b` is a power of 2 or 10, [`log2`](@ref) or [`log10`](@ref) should be used, as these will typically be faster and more accurate. For example,

log(x)
```

Compute the natural logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments to obtain complex results.

See also [`log1p`], [`log2`], [`log10`].

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"

log(A::StridedMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of `A`, i.e. the unique matrix $X$ such that $e^X = A$ and $-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi$ for all the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $X$. If `A` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, if `A` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [^AH12] and [^AHR13]). If `A` is real with no negative eigenvalues, then the real Schur form is computed. Otherwise, the complex Schur form is computed. Then the upper (quasi-)triangular algorithm in [^AHR13] is used on the upper (quasi-)triangular factor.

lpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the left with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest

"     March"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
lstat(file)
```

Like [`stat`](@ref), but for symbolic links gets the info for the link itself rather than the file it refers to. This function must be called on a file path rather than a file object or a file descriptor.
```
lstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
lstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = lpad("March", 20)
"               March"

julia> lstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
ltoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Little-endian to that used by the Host.
```
macroexpand(m::Module, x; recursive=true)
```

Take the expression `x` and return an equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded) for executing in module `m`. The `recursive` keyword controls whether deeper levels of nested macros are also expanded. This is demonstrated in the example below:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m1()
               42
           end
           macro m2()
               :(@m1())
           end
       end
M

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=true)
42

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=false)
:(#= REPL[16]:6 =# M.@m1)
```
```
map(f, c...) -> collection
```

Transform collection `c` by applying `f` to each element. For multiple collection arguments, apply `f` elementwise, and stop when when any of them is exhausted.

See also [`map!`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`mapreduce`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`Iterators.map`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> map(x -> x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 4
 6

julia> map(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 400, 5000])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 11
 22
 33
```

```
map(f, A::AbstractArray...) -> N-array
```

When acting on multi-dimensional arrays of the same [`ndims`](@ref), they must all have the same [`axes`](@ref), and the answer will too.

See also [`broadcast`](@ref), which allows mismatched sizes.

# Examples

```
julia> map(//, [1 2; 3 4], [4 3; 2 1])
2×2 Matrix{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//4  2//3
 3//2  4//1

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], zeros(2,1))
ERROR: DimensionMismatch

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], [1,10,100,1000], zeros(3,1))  # iterates until 3rd is exhausted
3-element Vector{Float64}:
   2.0
  13.0
 102.0
```
```
map!(function, destination, collection...)
```

Like [`map`](@ref), but stores the result in `destination` rather than a new collection. `destination` must be at least as large as the smallest collection.

See also: [`map`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`copyto!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = zeros(3);

julia> map!(x -> x * 2, a, [1, 2, 3]);

julia> a
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 2.0
 4.0

5-element Vector{Int64}:
 101

 105
   0
   0
```

```
map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))
```

Modifies `dict` by transforming each value from `val` to `f(val)`. Note that the type of `dict` cannot be changed: if `f(val)` is not an instance of the value type of `dict` then it will be converted to the value type if possible and otherwise raise an error.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))` requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2)
Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries:
  :a => 1
  :b => 2

julia> map!(v -> v-1, values(d))
ValueIterator for a Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  0
  1
```
```
mapfoldl(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity, as in [`foldl`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapfoldr(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity, as in [`foldr`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapreduce(f, op, itrs...; [init])
```

Apply function `f` to each element(s) in `itrs`, and then reduce the result using the binary function `op`. If provided, `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

[`mapreduce`](@ref) is functionally equivalent to calling `reduce(op, map(f, itr); init=init)`, but will in general execute faster since no intermediate collection needs to be created. See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref) and [`map`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mapreduce(x->x^2, +, [1:3;]) # == 1 + 4 + 9
14
```

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent. Additionally, some implementations may reuse the return value of `f` for elements that appear multiple times in `itr`. Use [`mapfoldl`](@ref) or [`mapfoldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity and invocation of `f` for every value.

```
mapreduce(f, op, A::AbstractArray...; dims=:, [init])
```

Evaluates to the same as `reduce(op, map(f, A...); dims=dims, init=init)`, but is generally faster because the intermediate array is avoided.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest

julia> mapreduce(isodd, |, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  1  1  1
```
```
mapslices(f, A; dims)
```

Transform the given dimensions of array `A` using function `f`. `f` is called on each slice of `A` of the form `A[...,:,...,:,...]`. `dims` is an integer vector specifying where the colons go in this expression. The results are concatenated along the remaining dimensions. For example, if `dims` is `[1,2]` and `A` is 4-dimensional, `f` is called on `A[:,:,i,j]` for all `i` and `j`.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```
```
mark(s::IO)
```

Add a mark at the current position of stream `s`. Return the marked position.

See also [`unmark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
match(r::Regex, s::AbstractString[, idx::Integer[, addopts]])
```

Search for the first match of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return a [`RegexMatch`](@ref) object containing the match, or nothing if the match failed. The matching substring can be retrieved by accessing `m.match` and the captured sequences can be retrieved by accessing `m.captures` The optional `idx` argument specifies an index at which to start the search.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a(.)a"
r"a(.)a"

julia> m = match(rx, "cabac")
RegexMatch("aba", 1="b")

julia> m.captures
1-element Vector{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}}}:
 "b"

julia> m.match
"aba"

julia> match(rx, "cabac", 3) === nothing
true
```
```
max(x, y, ...)
```

Return the maximum of the arguments (with respect to [`isless`](@ref)). See also the [`maximum`](@ref) function to take the maximum element from a collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> max(2, 5, 1)
5
```
```
maximum(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest result of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> maximum(length, ["Julion", "Julia", "Jule"])

julia> maximum(length, []; init=-1)
-1

julia> maximum(sin, Real[]; init=-1.0)  # good, since output of sin is >= -1
-1.0
```

```
maximum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest element in a collection.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

```

```
maximum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`max(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the maximum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `max.(a,b)`.

See also: [`maximum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmax`](@ref), [`argmax`](@ref).

```

```
maximum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

```
```
maxintfloat(T=Float64)
```

The largest consecutive integer-valued floating-point number that is exactly represented in the given floating-point type `T` (which defaults to `Float64`).

That is, `maxintfloat` returns the smallest positive integer-valued floating-point number `n` such that `n+1` is *not* exactly representable in the type `T`.

When an `Integer`-type value is needed, use `Integer(maxintfloat(T))`.

```
maxintfloat(T, S)
```

The largest consecutive integer representable in the given floating-point type `T` that also does not exceed the maximum integer representable by the integer type `S`.  Equivalently, it is the minimum of `maxintfloat(T)` and [`typemax(S)`](@ref).
```
merge(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. If the same key is present in another collection, the value for that key will be the value it has in the last collection listed. See also [`mergewith`](@ref) for custom handling of values with the same key.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict("foo" => 0.0, "bar" => 42.0)
Dict{String, Float64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> b = Dict("baz" => 17, "bar" => 4711)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 4711
  "baz" => 17

julia> merge(a, b)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 4711.0

julia> merge(b, a)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, bs::NamedTuple...)
```

Construct a new named tuple by merging two or more existing ones, in a left-associative manner. Merging proceeds left-to-right, between pairs of named tuples, and so the order of fields present in both the leftmost and rightmost named tuples take the same position as they are found in the leftmost named tuple. However, values are taken from matching fields in the rightmost named tuple that contains that field. Fields present in only the rightmost named tuple of a pair are appended at the end. A fallback is implemented for when only a single named tuple is supplied, with signature `merge(a::NamedTuple)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Merging 3 or more `NamedTuple` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), (b=4, d=5))
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2), (b=3, c=(d=1,)), (c=(d=2,),))
(a = 1, b = 3, c = (d = 2,))
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, iterable)
```

Interpret an iterable of key-value pairs as a named tuple, and perform a merge.

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), [:b=>4, :d=>5])
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```
```
merge!(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. See also [`merge`](@ref).

  3 => 4
  1 => 4
```
```
mergewith(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
mergewith(combine)
merge(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
mergewith!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
mergewith!(combine)
merge!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith!(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith!(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge!(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith!(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
methods(f, [types], [module])
```

Return the method table for `f`.

```
minimum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`min(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the minimum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `min.(a,b)`.

See also: [`minimum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmin`](@ref), [`argmin`](@ref).

```

```
minimum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

```
```
minimum!(r, A)
```

Compute the minimum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

```
minmax(x, y)
```

Return `(min(x,y), max(x,y))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> minmax('c','b')

```
```
mkdir(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Make a new directory with name `path` and permissions `mode`. `mode` defaults to `0o777`, modified by the current file creation mask. This function never creates more than one directory. If the directory already exists, or some intermediate directories do not exist, this function throws an error. See [`mkpath`](@ref) for a function which creates all required intermediate directories. Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> mkdir("testingdir")
"testingdir"

julia> cd("testingdir")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/testingdir"
```
```
mkpath(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Create all intermediate directories in the `path` as required. Directories are created with the permissions `mode` which defaults to `0o777` and is modified by the current file creation mask. Unlike [`mkdir`](@ref), `mkpath` does not error if `path` (or parts of it) already exists. However, an error will be thrown if `path` (or parts of it) points to an existing file. Return `path`.

If `path` includes a filename you will probably want to use `mkpath(dirname(path))` to avoid creating a directory using the filename.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd(mktempdir())

julia> mkpath("my/test/dir") # creates three directories
"my/test/dir"

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "my"

```
```
mktemp(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> (path, io)
```

Return `(path, io)`, where `path` is the path of a new temporary file in `parent` and `io` is an open file object for this path. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary file is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktemp` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


```
mktemp(f::Function, parent=tempdir())
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktemp(parent)`](@ref) and remove the temporary file upon completion.

See also: [`mktempdir`](@ref).
```
mktempdir(parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_", cleanup=true) -> path
```

Create a temporary directory in the `parent` directory with a name constructed from the given prefix and a random suffix, and return its path. Additionally, any trailing `X` characters may be replaced with random characters. If `parent` does not exist, throw an error. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary directory is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.


!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktempdir` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


See also: [`mktemp`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref).

```
mktempdir(f::Function, parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_")
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktempdir(parent; prefix)`](@ref) and remove the temporary directory all of its contents upon completion.

See also: [`mktemp`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.

```
mod(x::Integer, r::AbstractUnitRange)
```

Find `y` in the range `r` such that $x ≡ y (mod n)$, where `n = length(r)`, i.e. `y = mod(x - first(r), n) + first(r)`.

See also [`mod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod(0, Base.OneTo(3))  # mod1(0, 3)
3

julia> mod(3, 0:2)  # mod(3, 3)
0
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


```
mod(x, y)
rem(x, y, RoundDown)
```

The reduction of `x` modulo `y`, or equivalently, the remainder of `x` after floored division by `y`, i.e. `x - y*fld(x,y)` if computed without intermediate rounding.

The result will have the same sign as `y`, and magnitude less than `abs(y)` (with some exceptions, see note below).

!!! note
    When used with floating point values, the exact result may not be representable by the type, and so rounding error may occur. In particular, if the exact result is very close to `y`, then it may be rounded to `y`.

```

```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```
```
mod1(x, y)
```

Modulus after flooring division, returning a value `r` such that `mod(r, y) == mod(x, y)` in the range $(0, y]$ for positive `y` and in the range $[y,0)$ for negative `y`.

With integer arguments and positive `y`, this is equal to `mod(x, 1:y)`, and hence natural for 1-based indexing. By comparison, `mod(x, y) == mod(x, 0:y-1)` is natural for computations with offsets or strides.

See also [`mod`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod1(4, 2)
2

julia> mod1.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:

 2.9  3.0  0.1  1.0  2.0  2.9  3.0  0.1
```
```
mod2pi(x)
```

Modulus after division by `2π`, returning in the range $[0,2π)$.

This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact `2π`, and is therefore not exactly the same as `mod(x,2π)`, which would compute the modulus of `x` relative to division by the floating-point number `2π`.

!!! note
    Depending on the format of the input value, the closest representable value to 2π may be less than 2π. For example, the expression `mod2pi(2π)` will not return `0`, because the intermediate value of `2*π` is a `Float64` and `2*Float64(π) < 2*big(π)`. See [`rem2pi`](@ref) for more refined control of this behavior.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod2pi(9*pi/4)
0.7853981633974481
```
```
modf(x)
```

Return a tuple `(fpart, ipart)` of the fractional and integral parts of a number. Both parts have the same sign as the argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> modf(3.5)
(0.5, 3.0)

julia> modf(-3.5)
(-0.5, -3.0)
```
```
modifyproperty!(x, f::Symbol, op, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic! max(a().b, c)` returns `modifyproperty!(a(), :b, max, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where the first argument must be a `getfield` expression and is modified atomically.

See also [`modifyfield!`](@ref Core.modifyfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
mtime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mtime`.
```
muladd(x, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add: computes `x*y+z`, but allowing the add and multiply to be merged with each other or with surrounding operations for performance. For example, this may be implemented as an [`fma`](@ref) if the hardware supports it efficiently. The result can be different on different machines and can also be different on the same machine due to constant propagation or other optimizations. See [`fma`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> muladd(3, 2, 1)
7

julia> 3 * 2 + 1
7
```

```
muladd(A, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add, `A*y .+ z`, for matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. The result is always the same size as `A*y`, but `z` may be smaller, or a scalar.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    These methods require Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A=[1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]; B=[1.0 1.0; 1.0 1.0]; z=[0, 100];

julia> muladd(A, B, z)

   3.0    3.0
 107.0  107.0
```
```
mv(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false)
```

Move the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`. Return `dst`.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> write("hello.txt", "world");

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
"goodbye.txt"

julia> "hello.txt" in readdir()
false

julia> readline("goodbye.txt")
"world"

julia> write("hello.txt", "world2");

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
ERROR: ArgumentError: 'goodbye.txt' exists. `force=true` is required to remove 'goodbye.txt' before moving.

```
nameof(m::Module) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a `Module` as a [`Symbol`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nameof(Base.Broadcast)
:Broadcast
```

```
nameof(t::DataType) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType` (without its parent module) as a symbol.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct S{T}
           end
       end
Foo

julia> nameof(Foo.S{T} where T)
:S
```

```
nameof(f::Function) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a generic `Function` as a symbol. For anonymous functions, this is a compiler-generated name. For explicitly-declared subtypes of `Function`, it is the name of the function's type.
```
names(x::Module; all::Bool = false, imported::Bool = false)
```

Get an array of the names exported by a `Module`, excluding deprecated names. If `all` is true, then the list also includes non-exported names defined in the module, deprecated names, and compiler-generated names. If `imported` is true, then names explicitly imported from other modules are also included.

As a special case, all names defined in `Main` are considered "exported", since it is not idiomatic to explicitly export names from `Main`.

See also: [`@locals`](@ref Base.@locals), [`@__MODULE__`](@ref).
```
nand(x, y)
⊼(x, y)
```

Bitwise nand (not and) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊼ b` is a synonym for `nand(a,b)`, and `⊼` can be typed by tab-completing `\nand` or `\barwedge` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

ncodeunits(c::Char) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units required to encode a character as UTF-8. This is the number of bytes which will be printed if the character is written to an output stream, or `ncodeunits(string(c))` but computed efficiently.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 consider using `ncodeunits(string(c))`.


```
ncodeunits(s::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units in a string. Indices that are in bounds to access this string must satisfy `1 ≤ i ≤ ncodeunits(s)`. Not all such indices are valid – they may not be the start of a character, but they will return a code unit value when calling `codeunit(s,i)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ncodeunits("The Julia Language")
18

julia> ncodeunits("∫eˣ")
6

julia> ncodeunits('∫'), ncodeunits('e'), ncodeunits('ˣ')
(3, 1, 2)
```

```
ndigits(n::Integer; base::Integer=10, pad::Integer=1)
```

Compute the number of digits in integer `n` written in base `base` (`base` must not be in `[-1, 0, 1]`), optionally padded with zeros to a specified size (the result will never be less than `pad`).

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ndigits(12345)
5

julia> ndigits(1022, base=16)

```
```
ndims(A::AbstractArray) -> Integer
```

Return the number of dimensions of `A`.

```
```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `nextfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`prevfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the smallest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `x < y`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.

See also: [`prevfloat`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref).
```
nextind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts after index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the next character; if `i` is not the start of a character, move forward until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `0` return `1`. If `i` is in bounds but greater or equal to `lastindex(str)` return `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `nextind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `nextind` would reach `ncodeunits(str)+1` then each remaining iteration increases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `nextind` can return a value greater than `ncodeunits(str)+1`.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `s` or is equal to `0`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextind("α", 0)
1

julia> nextind("α", 1)
3

julia> nextind("α", 3)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [3]

```
```
nextpow(a, x)
```

The smallest `a^n` not less than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must be greater than 0.

nextprod(factors::Union{Tuple,AbstractVector}, n)
```

Next integer greater than or equal to `n` that can be written as $\prod k_i^{p_i}$ for integers $p_1$, $p_2$, etcetera, for factors $k_i$ in `factors`.

# Examples

```
nor(x, y)
⊽(x, y)
```

Bitwise nor (not or) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊽ b` is a synonym for `nor(a,b)`, and `⊽` can be typed by tab-completing `\nor` or `\barvee` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest

normpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Normalize a path, removing "." and ".." entries and changing "/" to the canonical path separator for the system.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> normpath("/home/myuser/../example.jl")
"/home/example.jl"

julia> normpath("Documents/Julia") == joinpath("Documents", "Julia")
true
```

```
normpath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to a normalized path by joining them together and removing "." and ".." entries. Equivalent to `normpath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)
```

Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them `val`. If `all` is `true` (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If `error` is `true`, the passed value is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

Return the count of tasks woken up. Return 0 if no tasks are waiting on `condition`.
```
ntoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Network byte order (big-endian) to that used by the Host.
```
ntuple(f::Function, n::Integer)
```

Create a tuple of length `n`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, 4)
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```
ntuple(f, ::Val{N})
```

Create a tuple of length `N`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element. By taking a `Val(N)` argument, it is possible that this version of ntuple may generate more efficient code than the version taking the length as an integer. But `ntuple(f, N)` is preferable to `ntuple(f, Val(N))` in cases where `N` cannot be determined at compile time.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, Val(4))
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```
```
numerator(x)
```

Numerator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> numerator(2//3)
2

julia> numerator(4)
4
```
```
objectid(x) -> UInt
```

Get a hash value for `x` based on object identity. `objectid(x)==objectid(y)` if `x === y`.

See also [`hash`](@ref), [`IdDict`](@ref).
```
occursin(needle::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern,AbstractChar}, haystack::AbstractString)
```

Determine whether the first argument is a substring of the second. If `needle` is a regular expression, checks whether `haystack` contains a match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> occursin("Julia", "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin('a', "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "aba")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "abba")
false
```

See also [`contains`](@ref).

```
occursin(haystack)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument occurs in `haystack`, i.e. a function equivalent to `needle -> occursin(needle, haystack)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(occursin)}`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
oftype(x, y)
```

Convert `y` to the type of `x` (`convert(typeof(x), y)`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 4;

julia> y = 3.;

julia> oftype(x, y)
3

julia> oftype(y, x)
4.0
```
```
one(x)
one(T::type)
```

Return a multiplicative identity for `x`: a value such that `one(x)*x == x*one(x) == x`.  Alternatively `one(T)` can take a type `T`, in which case `one` returns a multiplicative identity for any `x` of type `T`.

If possible, `one(x)` returns a value of the same type as `x`, and `one(T)` returns a value of type `T`.  However, this may not be the case for types representing dimensionful quantities (e.g. time in days), since the multiplicative identity must be dimensionless.  In that case, `one(x)` should return an identity value of the same precision (and shape, for matrices) as `x`.

If you want a quantity that is of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`, even if `x` is dimensionful, use [`oneunit`](@ref) instead.

See also the [`identity`](@ref) function, and `I` in [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg) for the identity matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> one(3.7)

julia> one(Int)
1

julia> import Dates; one(Dates.Day(1))
1
```
```
ones([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
ones([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all ones with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ones(1,2)
1×2 Matrix{Float64}:

 1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im
```
```
oneunit(x::T)
oneunit(T::Type)
```

Returns `T(one(x))`, where `T` is either the type of the argument or (if a type is passed) the argument.  This differs from [`one`](@ref) for dimensionful quantities: `one` is dimensionless (a multiplicative identity) while `oneunit` is dimensionful (of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> oneunit(3.7)
1.0

julia> import Dates; oneunit(Dates.Day)
1 day
```
```
only(x)
```

Return the one and only element of collection `x`, or throw an [`ArgumentError`](@ref) if the collection has zero or multiple elements.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`last`](@ref).

open(f::Function, args...; kwargs...)
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of `open(args...; kwargs...)` and close the resulting file descriptor upon completion.

# Examples

open(filename::AbstractString; lock = true, keywords...) -> IOStream
```

Open a file in a mode specified by five boolean keyword arguments:

| Keyword    | Description            | Default                               |
|:---------- |:---------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| `read`     | open for reading       | `!write`                              |
| `write`    | open for writing       | `truncate \| append`                  |
| `create`   | create if non-existent | `!read & write \| truncate \| append` |
| `truncate` | truncate to zero size  | `!read & write`                       |
| `append`   | seek to end            | `false`                               |

The default when no keywords are passed is to open files for reading only. Returns a stream for accessing the opened file.

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(filename::AbstractString, [mode::AbstractString]; lock = true) -> IOStream
```

Alternate syntax for open, where a string-based mode specifier is used instead of the five booleans. The values of `mode` correspond to those from `fopen(3)` or Perl `open`, and are equivalent to setting the following boolean groups:

| Mode | Description                   | Keywords                       |
|:---- |:----------------------------- |:------------------------------ |
| `r`  | read                          | none                           |
| `w`  | write, create, truncate       | `write = true`                 |
| `a`  | write, create, append         | `append = true`                |
| `r+` | read, write                   | `read = true, write = true`    |
| `w+` | read, write, create, truncate | `truncate = true, read = true` |

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(fd::OS_HANDLE) -> IO
```

Take a raw file descriptor wrap it in a Julia-aware IO type, and take ownership of the fd handle. Call `open(Libc.dup(fd))` to avoid the ownership capture of the original handle.

!!! warning
    Do not call this on a handle that's already owned by some other part of the system.


```
open(command, mode::AbstractString, stdio=devnull)
```

Run `command` asynchronously. Like `open(command, stdio; read, write)` except specifying the read and write flags via a mode string instead of keyword arguments. Possible mode strings are:

| Mode | Description | Keywords                    |
|:---- |:----------- |:--------------------------- |
| `r`  | read        | none                        |
| `w`  | write       | `write = true`              |
| `r+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |
| `w+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |

```
open(command, stdio=devnull; write::Bool = false, read::Bool = !write)
```

Start running `command` asynchronously, and return a `process::IO` object.  If `read` is true, then reads from the process come from the process's standard output and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard input stream.  If `write` is true, then writes go to the process's standard input and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard output stream. The process's standard error stream is connected to the current global `stderr`.

```
open(f::Function, command, args...; kwargs...)
```

Similar to `open(command, args...; kwargs...)`, but calls `f(stream)` on the resulting process stream, then closes the input stream and waits for the process to complete. Return the value returned by `f` on success. Throw an error if the process failed, or if the process attempts to print anything to stdout.
```
operm(file)
```

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions for people who neither own the file nor are a member of the group owning the file
```
pairs(collection)
```

Return an iterator over `key => value` pairs for any collection that maps a set of keys to a set of values. This includes arrays, where the keys are the array indices.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict(zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]))
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> pairs(a)
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> foreach(println, pairs(["a", "b", "c"]))
1 => "a"
2 => "b"
3 => "c"

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> pairs |> collect
3-element Vector{Pair{Symbol, Int64}}:
 :a => 1
 :b => 2
 :c => 3

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> collect
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
pairs(IndexLinear(), A)
pairs(IndexCartesian(), A)
pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
```

An iterator that accesses each element of the array `A`, returning `i => x`, where `i` is the index for the element and `x = A[i]`. Identical to `pairs(A)`, except that the style of index can be selected. Also similar to `enumerate(A)`, except `i` will be a valid index for `A`, while `enumerate` always counts from 1 regardless of the indices of `A`.

Specifying [`IndexLinear()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be an integer; specifying [`IndexCartesian()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be a [`CartesianIndex`](@ref); specifying `IndexStyle(A)` chooses whichever has been defined as the native indexing style for array `A`.

Mutation of the bounds of the underlying array will invalidate this iterator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = ["a" "d"; "b" "e"; "c" "f"];

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
4 d
5 e
6 f

julia> S = view(A, 1:2, :);

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(S), S)
           println("$index $value")
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1) a
CartesianIndex(2, 1) b
CartesianIndex(1, 2) d
CartesianIndex(2, 2) e
```

See also [`IndexStyle`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref).
```
parent(A)
```

Return the underlying "parent array”. This parent array of objects of types `SubArray`, `ReshapedArray` or `LinearAlgebra.Transpose` is what was passed as an argument to `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, etc. during object creation. If the input is not a wrapped object, return the input itself. If the input is wrapped multiple times, only the outermost wrapper will be removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> V = view(A, 1:2, :)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1:2, :) with eltype Int64:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(V)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
parentindices(A)
```

Return the indices in the [`parent`](@ref) which correspond to the array view `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> V = view(A, 1, :)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1, :) with eltype Int64:
 1
 2

julia> parentindices(V)
(1, Base.Slice(Base.OneTo(2)))
```
```
parentmodule(m::Module) -> Module
```

Get a module's enclosing `Module`. `Main` is its own parent.

See also: [`names`](@ref), [`nameof`](@ref), [`fullname`](@ref), [`@__MODULE__`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parentmodule(Main)
Main

julia> parentmodule(Base.Broadcast)
Base
```

```
parentmodule(t::DataType) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the definition of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct Int end
       end
Foo

julia> parentmodule(Int)
Core

julia> parentmodule(Foo.Int)
Foo
```

```
parentmodule(f::Function) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the (first) definition of a generic function.

```
parentmodule(f::Function, types) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing a given definition of a generic function.
```
parse(type, str; base)
```

Parse a string as a number. For `Integer` types, a base can be specified (the default is 10). For floating-point types, the string is parsed as a decimal floating-point number.  `Complex` types are parsed from decimal strings of the form `"R±Iim"` as a `Complex(R,I)` of the requested type; `"i"` or `"j"` can also be used instead of `"im"`, and `"R"` or `"Iim"` are also permitted. If the string does not contain a valid number, an error is raised.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `parse(Bool, str)` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse(Int, "1234")
1234

julia> parse(Int, "1234", base = 5)
194

julia> parse(Int, "afc", base = 16)
2812

julia> parse(Float64, "1.2e-3")
0.0012

julia> parse(Complex{Float64}, "3.2e-1 + 4.5im")
0.32 + 4.5im
```

```
parse(::Type{Platform}, triplet::AbstractString)
```

Parses a string platform triplet back into a `Platform` object.
```
partialsort(v, k, by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Variant of [`partialsort!`](@ref) which copies `v` before partially sorting it, thereby returning the same thing as `partialsort!` but leaving `v` unmodified.
```
partialsort!(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Partially sort the vector `v` in place, according to the order specified by `by`, `lt` and `rev` so that the value at index `k` (or range of adjacent values if `k` is a range) occurs at the position where it would appear if the array were fully sorted via a non-stable algorithm. If `k` is a single index, that value is returned; if `k` is a range, an array of values at those indices is returned. Note that `partialsort!` does not fully sort the input array.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4)
4

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4, rev=true)
2

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
partialsortperm(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return a partial permutation `I` of the vector `v`, so that `v[I]` returns values of a fully sorted version of `v` at index `k`. If `k` is a range, a vector of indices is returned; if `k` is an integer, a single index is returned. The order is specified using the same keywords as `sort!`. The permutation is stable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

Note that this function is equivalent to, but more efficient than, calling `sortperm(...)[k]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> v[partialsortperm(v, 1)]
1

julia> p = partialsortperm(v, 1:3)
3-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 1:3) with eltype Int64:
 2
 4
 3

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
```
```
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false, initialized=false)
```

Like [`partialsortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix` the same size as `v`, which is used to store (a permutation of) the indices of `v`.

If the index vector `ix` is initialized with the indices of `v` (or a permutation thereof), `initialized` should be set to `true`.

If `initialized` is `false` (the default), then `ix` is initialized to contain the indices of `v`.

If `initialized` is `true`, but `ix` does not contain (a permutation of) the indices of `v`, the behavior of `partialsortperm!` is undefined.

(Typically, the indices of `v` will be `1:length(v)`, although if `v` has an alternative array type with non-one-based indices, such as an `OffsetArray`, `ix` must also be an `OffsetArray` with the same indices, and must contain as values (a permutation of) these same indices.)

Upon return, `ix` is guaranteed to have the indices `k` in their sorted positions, such that

```julia
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k);
v[ix[k]] == partialsort(v, k)
```

The return value is the `k`th element of `ix` if `k` is an integer, or view into `ix` if `k` is a range.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> ix = Vector{Int}(undef, 4);

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 1)
2

julia> ix = [1:4;];

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 2:3, initialized=true)
2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 2:3) with eltype Int64:
 4

```

```

```
```
pathof(m::Module)
```

Return the path of the `m.jl` file that was used to `import` module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package.

Use [`dirname`](@ref) to get the directory part and [`basename`](@ref) to get the file name part of the path.
```
peek(stream[, T=UInt8])
```

Read and return a value of type `T` from a stream without advancing the current position in the stream.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = IOBuffer("julia");

julia> peek(b)
0x6a

julia> position(b)
0

julia> peek(b, Char)
'j': ASCII/Unicode U+006A (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The method which accepts a type requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
permute!(v, p)
```

Permute vector `v` in-place, according to permutation `p`. No checking is done to verify that `p` is a permutation.

To return a new permutation, use `v[p]`. Note that this is generally faster than `permute!(v,p)` for large vectors.

See also [`invpermute!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> permute!(A, perm);

julia> A
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 3
 1
```

```
permute!(X::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         p::AbstractVector{<:Integer}, q::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         [C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

Bilaterally permute `A`, storing result `PAQ` (`A[p,q]`) in `X`. Stores intermediate result `(AQ)^T` (`transpose(A[:,q])`) in optional argument `C` if present. Requires that none of `X`, `A`, and, if present, `C` alias each other; to store result `PAQ` back into `A`, use the following method lacking `X`:

```
permute!(A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, p::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         q::AbstractVector{<:Integer}[, C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         [workcolptr::Vector{Ti}]]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

`X`'s dimensions must match those of `A` (`size(X, 1) == size(A, 1)` and `size(X, 2) == size(A, 2)`), and `X` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(X)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(X)) >= nnz(A)`). Column-permutation `q`'s length must match `A`'s column count (`length(q) == size(A, 2)`). Row-permutation `p`'s length must match `A`'s row count (`length(p) == size(A, 1)`).

`C`'s dimensions must match those of `transpose(A)` (`size(C, 1) == size(A, 2)` and `size(C, 2) == size(A, 1)`), and `C` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(C)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(C)) >= nnz(A)`).

For additional (algorithmic) information, and for versions of these methods that forgo argument checking, see (unexported) parent methods `unchecked_noalias_permute!` and `unchecked_aliasing_permute!`.

See also [`permute`](@ref).
```
permutedims(A::AbstractArray, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `A`. `perm` is a vector or a tuple of length `ndims(A)` specifying the permutation.

See also [`permutedims!`](@ref), [`PermutedDimsArray`](@ref), [`transpose`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

[:, :, 2] =
 5  7

julia> permutedims(A, (3, 2, 1))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3

[:, :, 2] =
 2  4
 6  8

julia> B = randn(5, 7, 11, 13);

julia> perm = [4,1,3,2];

julia> size(permutedims(B, perm))
(13, 5, 11, 7)

julia> size(B)[perm] == ans
true
```

```
permutedims(m::AbstractMatrix)
```

Permute the dimensions of the matrix `m`, by flipping the elements across the diagonal of the matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> b = [5 6; 7 8];

julia> c = [9 10; 11 12];

julia> d = [13 14; 15 16];

julia> X = [[a] [b]; [c] [d]]
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]     [5 6; 7 8]
 [9 10; 11 12]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> permutedims(X)
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [9 10; 11 12]
 [5 6; 7 8]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> transpose(X)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [9 11; 10 12]
 [5 7; 6 8]  [13 15; 14 16]
```

```
permutedims(v::AbstractVector)
```

Reshape vector `v` into a `1 × length(v)` row matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> permutedims([1, 2, 3, 4])
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4

julia> V = [[[1 2; 3 4]]; [[5 6; 7 8]]]
2-element Vector{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]
 [5 6; 7 8]

julia> permutedims(V)
1×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [5 6; 7 8]

julia> transpose(V)
1×2 transpose(::Vector{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [5 7; 6 8]
```
```
permutedims!(dest, src, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `src` and store the result in the array `dest`. `perm` is a vector specifying a permutation of length `ndims(src)`. The preallocated array `dest` should have `size(dest) == size(src)[perm]` and is completely overwritten. No in-place permutation is supported and unexpected results will happen if `src` and `dest` have overlapping memory regions.

See also [`permutedims`](@ref).
```
pipeline(command; stdin, stdout, stderr, append=false)
```

Redirect I/O to or from the given `command`. Keyword arguments specify which of the command's streams should be redirected. `append` controls whether file output appends to the file. This is a more general version of the 2-argument `pipeline` function. `pipeline(from, to)` is equivalent to `pipeline(from, stdout=to)` when `from` is a command, and to `pipeline(to, stdin=from)` when `from` is another kind of data source.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`dothings`, stdout="out.txt", stderr="errs.txt"))
run(pipeline(`update`, stdout="log.txt", append=true))
```

```
pipeline(from, to, ...)
```

Create a pipeline from a data source to a destination. The source and destination can be commands, I/O streams, strings, or results of other `pipeline` calls. At least one argument must be a command. Strings refer to filenames. When called with more than two arguments, they are chained together from left to right. For example, `pipeline(a,b,c)` is equivalent to `pipeline(pipeline(a,b),c)`. This provides a more concise way to specify multi-stage pipelines.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`ls`, `grep xyz`))
run(pipeline(`ls`, "out.txt"))
run(pipeline("out.txt", `grep xyz`))
```
```
pkgdir(m::Module[, paths::String...])
```

Return the root directory of the package that imported module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package. Optionally further path component strings can be provided to construct a path within the package root.

```julia-repl
julia> pkgdir(Foo)
"/path/to/Foo.jl"

julia> pkgdir(Foo, "src", "file.jl")
"/path/to/Foo.jl/src/file.jl"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The optional argument `paths` requires at least Julia 1.7.

No documentation found.

Binding `pkgversion` does not exist.
```
pointer(array [, index])
```

Get the native address of an array or string, optionally at a given location `index`.

This function is "unsafe". Be careful to ensure that a Julia reference to `array` exists as long as this pointer will be used. The [`GC.@preserve`](@ref) macro should be used to protect the `array` argument from garbage collection within a given block of code.

Calling [`Ref(array[, index])`](@ref Ref) is generally preferable to this function as it guarantees validity.
```
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

Get the memory address of a Julia object as a `Ptr`. The existence of the resulting `Ptr` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the `Ptr` will be used.

This function may not be called on immutable objects, since they do not have stable memory addresses.

See also [`unsafe_pointer_to_objref`](@ref).
```
pop!(collection) -> item
```

Remove an item in `collection` and return it. If `collection` is an ordered container, the last item is returned; for unordered containers, an arbitrary element is returned.

See also: [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), and [`push!`](@ref).

julia> pop!(Dict(1=>2))
1 => 2
```

```
pop!(collection, key[, default])
```

Delete and return the mapping for `key` if it exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>3);

julia> pop!(d, "d")
ERROR: KeyError: key "d" not found
Stacktrace:

julia> pop!(d, "e", 4)
4
```
```
popat!(a::Vector, i::Integer, [default])
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return it. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap. When `i` is not a valid index for `a`, return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

See also: [`pop!`](@ref), [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

popdisplay()
popdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pop the topmost backend off of the display-backend stack, or the topmost copy of `d` in the second variant.
```
popfirst!(collection) -> item

```
precision(num::AbstractFloat; base::Integer=2)
precision(T::Type; base::Integer=2)
```

Get the precision of a floating point number, as defined by the effective number of bits in the significand, or the precision of a floating-point type `T` (its current default, if `T` is a variable-precision type like [`BigFloat`](@ref)).

If `base` is specified, then it returns the maximum corresponding number of significand digits in that base.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"

precompile(f, args::Tuple{Vararg{Any}})
```

Compile the given function `f` for the argument tuple (of types) `args`, but do not execute it.
```
prepend!(a::Vector, collections...) -> collection
```

Insert the elements of each `collections` to the beginning of `a`.

When `collections` specifies multiple collections, order is maintained: elements of `collections[1]` will appear leftmost in `a`, and so on.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Specifying multiple collections to be prepended requires at least Julia 1.6.

```jldoctest
julia> prepend!([3], [1, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> prepend!([6], [1, 2], [3, 4, 5])
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `prevfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`nextfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the largest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `y < x`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `-Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.
```
prevind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts before index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the previous character; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `1` return `0`. If `i` is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1` return `lastindex(str)`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `prevind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `prevind` would reach `0` then each remaining iteration decreases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `prevind` can return a negative value.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `str` or is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevind("α", 3)
1

julia> prevind("α", 1)
0

julia> prevind("α", 0)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [0]
[...]

julia> prevind("α", 2, 2)
0

julia> prevind("α", 2, 3)
-1
```
```
prevpow(a, x)
```

The largest `a^n` not greater than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must not be less than 1.

See also [`nextpow`](@ref), [`isqrt`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevpow(2, 7)
4

julia> prevpow(2, 9)
8

julia> prevpow(5, 20)
5

julia> prevpow(4, 16)
16
```
```
print([io::IO], xs...)
```

Write to `io` (or to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref) if `io` is not given) a canonical (un-decorated) text representation. The representation used by `print` includes minimal formatting and tries to avoid Julia-specific details.

`print` falls back to calling `show`, so most types should just define `show`. Define `print` if your type has a separate "plain" representation. For example, `show` displays strings with quotes, and `print` displays strings without quotes.

See also [`println`](@ref), [`string`](@ref), [`printstyled`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> print(io, "Hello", ' ', :World!)

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello World!"
```
```
println([io::IO], xs...)
```

Print (using [`print`](@ref)) `xs` to `io` followed by a newline. If `io` is not supplied, prints to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref).

See also [`printstyled`](@ref) to add colors etc.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println("Hello, world")
Hello, world

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> println(io, "Hello", ',', " world.")

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello, world.\n"
```
```
printstyled([io], xs...; bold::Bool=false, underline::Bool=false, blink::Bool=false, reverse::Bool=false, hidden::Bool=false, color::Union{Symbol,Int}=:normal)
```

Print `xs` in a color specified as a symbol or integer, optionally in bold.

Keyword `color` may take any of the values `:normal`, `:default`, `:bold`, `:black`, `:blink`, `:blue`, `:cyan`, `:green`, `:hidden`, `:light_black`, `:light_blue`, `:light_cyan`, `:light_green`, `:light_magenta`, `:light_red`, `:light_white`, `:light_yellow`, `:magenta`, `:nothing`, `:red`, `:reverse`, `:underline`, `:white`, or  `:yellow` or an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive. Note that not all terminals support 256 colors.

Keywords `bold=true`, `underline=true`, `blink=true` are self-explanatory. Keyword `reverse=true` prints with foreground and background colors exchanged, and `hidden=true` should be invisibe in the terminal but can still be copied. These properties can be used in any combination.

See also [`print`](@ref), [`println`](@ref), [`show`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Keywords except `color` and `bold` were added in Julia 1.7.

```
process_exited(p::Process)
```

Determine whether a process has exited.
```
process_running(p::Process)
```

Determine whether a process is currently running.
```
prod(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of `f` applied to each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prod(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
576
```

```
prod(itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of all elements of a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


See also: [`reduce`](@ref), [`cumprod`](@ref), [`any`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prod(1:5)
120

julia> prod(1:5; init = 1.0)
120.0
```

```
prod(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply elements of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8

julia> prod(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  2
 12
```

```
prod(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply the results of calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 9  64

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
   4
 144
```
```
prod!(r, A)
```

Multiply elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod!([1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
  2
 12

julia> prod!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8
```
```
promote(xs...)
```

Convert all arguments to a common type, and return them all (as a tuple). If no arguments can be converted, an error is raised.

See also: [`promote_type`], [`promote_rule`].

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote(Int8(1), Float16(4.5), Float32(4.1))
(1.0f0, 4.5f0, 4.1f0)
```
```
promote_rule(type1, type2)
```

Specifies what type should be used by [`promote`](@ref) when given values of types `type1` and `type2`. This function should not be called directly, but should have definitions added to it for new types as appropriate.
```
promote_shape(s1, s2)
```

Check two array shapes for compatibility, allowing trailing singleton dimensions, and return whichever shape has more dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = fill(1, (3,4,1,1,1));

julia> b = fill(1, (3,4));

julia> promote_shape(a,b)
(Base.OneTo(3), Base.OneTo(4), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1))

julia> promote_shape((2,3,1,4), (2, 3, 1, 4, 1))
(2, 3, 1, 4, 1)
```
```
promote_type(type1, type2)
```

Promotion refers to converting values of mixed types to a single common type. `promote_type` represents the default promotion behavior in Julia when operators (usually mathematical) are given arguments of differing types. `promote_type` generally tries to return a type which can at least approximate most values of either input type without excessively widening.  Some loss is tolerated; for example, `promote_type(Int64, Float64)` returns [`Float64`](@ref) even though strictly, not all [`Int64`](@ref) values can be represented exactly as `Float64` values.

See also: [`promote`](@ref), [`promote_typejoin`](@ref), [`promote_rule`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote_type(Int64, Float64)
Float64

julia> promote_type(Int32, Int64)
Int64

julia> promote_type(Float32, BigInt)
BigFloat

julia> promote_type(Int16, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int64, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int8, UInt16)
UInt16
```

!!! warning "Don't overload this directly"
    To overload promotion for your own types you should overload [`promote_rule`](@ref). `promote_type` calls `promote_rule` internally to determine the type. Overloading `promote_type` directly can cause ambiguity errors.

```
propertynames(x, private=false)
```

Get a tuple or a vector of the properties (`x.property`) of an object `x`. This is typically the same as [`fieldnames(typeof(x))`](@ref), but types that overload [`getproperty`](@ref) should generally overload `propertynames` as well to get the properties of an instance of the type.

`propertynames(x)` may return only "public" property names that are part of the documented interface of `x`.   If you want it to also return "private" fieldnames intended for internal use, pass `true` for the optional second argument. REPL tab completion on `x.` shows only the `private=false` properties.

See also: [`hasproperty`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).
```
push!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` in `collection`. If `collection` is an ordered container, the items are inserted at the end (in the given order).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> push!([1, 2, 3], 4, 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```

If `collection` is ordered, use [`append!`](@ref) to add all the elements of another collection to it. The result of the preceding example is equivalent to `append!([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`. For `AbstractSet` objects, [`union!`](@ref) can be used instead.

See [`sizehint!`](@ref) for notes about the performance model.

See also [`pushfirst!`](@ref).
```
pushdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pushes a new display `d` on top of the global display-backend stack. Calling `display(x)` or `display(mime, x)` will display `x` on the topmost compatible backend in the stack (i.e., the topmost backend that does not throw a [`MethodError`](@ref)).
```
pushfirst!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` at the beginning of `collection`.

This function is called `unshift` in many other programming languages.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> pushfirst!([1, 2, 3, 4], 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 1
 2
 3
 4
```
```
put!(c::Channel, v)
```

Append an item `v` to the channel `c`. Blocks if the channel is full.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`take!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `v` now gets converted to the channel's type with [`convert`](@ref) as `put!` is called.


```
put!(rr::Future, v)
```

Store a value to a [`Future`](@ref) `rr`. `Future`s are write-once remote references. A `put!` on an already set `Future` throws an `Exception`. All asynchronous remote calls return `Future`s and set the value to the return value of the call upon completion.

```
put!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Store a set of values to the [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). If the channel is full, blocks until space is available. Return the first argument.
```
pwd() -> AbstractString
```

Get the current working directory.

See also: [`cd`](@ref), [`tempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"
```
```
rad2deg(x)
```

Convert `x` from radians to degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rad2deg(pi)
180.0
```
```
rand([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [S], [dims...])
```

Pick a random element or array of random elements from the set of values specified by `S`; `S` can be

  * an indexable collection (for example `1:9` or `('x', "y", :z)`),
  * an `AbstractDict` or `AbstractSet` object,
  * a string (considered as a collection of characters), or
  * a type: the set of values to pick from is then equivalent to `typemin(S):typemax(S)` for integers (this is not applicable to [`BigInt`](@ref)), to $[0, 1)$ for floating point numbers and to $[0, 1)+i[0, 1)$ for complex floating point numbers;

`S` defaults to [`Float64`](@ref). When only one argument is passed besides the optional `rng` and is a `Tuple`, it is interpreted as a collection of values (`S`) and not as `dims`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Support for `S` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Int, 2)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1339893410598768192
 1575814717733606317

julia> using Random

julia> rand(MersenneTwister(0), Dict(1=>2, 3=>4))
1=>2

julia> rand((2, 3))
3

julia> rand(Float64, (2, 3))
2×3 Array{Float64,2}:
 0.999717  0.0143835  0.540787
 0.696556  0.783855   0.938235
```

!!! note
    The complexity of `rand(rng, s::Union{AbstractDict,AbstractSet})` is linear in the length of `s`, unless an optimized method with constant complexity is available, which is the case for `Dict`, `Set` and dense `BitSet`s. For more than a few calls, use `rand(rng, collect(s))` instead, or either `rand(rng, Dict(s))` or `rand(rng, Set(s))` as appropriate.

```
randn([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [T=Float64], [dims...])
```

Generate a normally-distributed random number of type `T` with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Optionally generate an array of normally-distributed random numbers. The `Base` module currently provides an implementation for the types [`Float16`](@ref), [`Float32`](@ref), and [`Float64`](@ref) (the default), and their [`Complex`](@ref) counterparts. When the type argument is complex, the values are drawn from the circularly symmetric complex normal distribution of variance 1 (corresponding to real and imaginary part having independent normal distribution with mean zero and variance `1/2`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using Random

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234);

julia> randn(rng, ComplexF64)
0.6133070881429037 - 0.6376291670853887im

julia> randn(rng, ComplexF32, (2, 3))
2×3 Matrix{ComplexF32}:
 -0.349649-0.638457im  0.376756-0.192146im  -0.396334-0.0136413im
  0.611224+1.56403im   0.355204-0.365563im  0.0905552+1.31012im
```
```
range(start, stop, length)
range(start, stop; length, step)
range(start; length, stop, step)
range(;start, length, stop, step)
```

Construct a specialized array with evenly spaced elements and optimized storage (an [`AbstractRange`](@ref)) from the arguments. Mathematically a range is uniquely determined by any three of `start`, `step`, `stop` and `length`. Valid invocations of range are:

  * Call `range` with any three of `start`, `step`, `stop`, `length`.
  * Call `range` with two of `start`, `stop`, `length`. In this case `step` will be assumed to be one. If both arguments are Integers, a [`UnitRange`](@ref) will be returned.
  * Call `range` with one of `stop` or `length`. `start` and `step` will be assumed to be one.

See Extended Help for additional details on the returned type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, length=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, stop=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, step=5, length=100)
1:5:496

julia> range(1, step=5, stop=100)
1:5:96

julia> range(1, 10, length=101)
1.0:0.09:10.0

julia> range(1, 100, step=5)
1:5:96

julia> range(stop=10, length=5)
6:10

julia> range(stop=10, step=1, length=5)
6:1:10

julia> range(start=1, step=1, stop=10)
1:1:10

julia> range(; length = 10)
Base.OneTo(10)

julia> range(; stop = 6)
Base.OneTo(6)

julia> range(; stop = 6.5)
1.0:1.0:6.0
```

If `length` is not specified and `stop - start` is not an integer multiple of `step`, a range that ends before `stop` will be produced.

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, 3.5, step=2)
1.0:2.0:3.0
```

Special care is taken to ensure intermediate values are computed rationally. To avoid this induced overhead, see the [`LinRange`](@ref) constructor.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `stop` as a positional argument requires at least Julia 1.1.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The versions without keyword arguments and `start` as a keyword argument require at least Julia 1.7.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The versions with `stop` as a sole keyword argument, or `length` as a sole keyword argument require at least Julia 1.8.


# Extended Help

`range` will produce a `Base.OneTo` when the arguments are Integers and

  * Only `length` is provided
  * Only `stop` is provided

`range` will produce a `UnitRange` when the arguments are Integers and

  * Only `start`  and `stop` are provided

```
rationalize([T<:Integer=Int,] x; tol::Real=eps(x))
```

Approximate floating point number `x` as a [`Rational`](@ref) number with components of the given integer type. The result will differ from `x` by no more than `tol`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rationalize(5.6)
28//5

julia> a = rationalize(BigInt, 10.3)
103//10

julia> typeof(numerator(a))
BigInt
```
```
read(io::IO, T)
```

Read a single value of type `T` from `io`, in canonical binary representation.

Note that Julia does not convert the endianness for you. Use [`ntoh`](@ref) or [`ltoh`](@ref) for this purpose.

```
read(io::IO, String)
```

Read the entirety of `io`, as a `String` (see also [`readchomp`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, String)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization"
```

```
read(filename::AbstractString, args...)
```

Open a file and read its contents. `args` is passed to `read`: this is equivalent to `open(io->read(io, args...), filename)`.

```
read(filename::AbstractString, String)
```

Read the entire contents of a file as a string.

```
read(s::IO, nb=typemax(Int))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

```
read(s::IOStream, nb::Integer; all=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.

```
read(command::Cmd)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as an array of bytes.

```
read(command::Cmd, String)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as a `String`.
```
read!(stream::IO, array::AbstractArray)
read!(filename::AbstractString, array::AbstractArray)
```

Read binary data from an I/O stream or file, filling in `array`.
```
readavailable(stream)
```

Read available buffered data from a stream. Actual I/O is performed only if no data has already been buffered. The result is a `Vector{UInt8}`.

!!! warning
    The amount of data returned is implementation-dependent; for example it can depend on the internal choice of buffer size. Other functions such as [`read`](@ref) should generally be used instead.

```
readbytes!(stream::IO, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

```
readbytes!(stream::IOStream, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b); all::Bool=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.
```
readchomp(x)
```

Read the entirety of `x` as a string and remove a single trailing newline if there is one. Equivalent to `chomp(read(x, String))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> readchomp("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members."

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```
```
readdir(dir::AbstractString=pwd();
    join::Bool = false,
    sort::Bool = true,
) -> Vector{String}
```

Return the names in the directory `dir` or the current working directory if not given. When `join` is false, `readdir` returns just the names in the directory as is; when `join` is true, it returns `joinpath(dir, name)` for each `name` so that the returned strings are full paths. If you want to get absolute paths back, call `readdir` with an absolute directory path and `join` set to true.

By default, `readdir` sorts the list of names it returns. If you want to skip sorting the names and get them in the order that the file system lists them, you can use `readdir(dir, sort=false)` to opt out of sorting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `join` and `sort` keyword arguments require at least Julia 1.4.

readeach(io::IO, T)
```

Return an iterable object yielding [`read(io, T)`](@ref).

See also [`skipchars`](@ref), [`eachline`](@ref), [`readuntil`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `readeach` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");

julia> for c in readeach(io, Char)
           c == '\n' && break
           print(c)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.
```
```
readline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read a single line of text from the given I/O stream or file (defaults to `stdin`). When reading from a file, the text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. Lines in the input end with `'\n'` or `"\r\n"` or the end of an input stream. When `keep` is false (as it is by default), these trailing newline characters are removed from the line before it is returned. When `keep` is true, they are returned as part of the line.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readline("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> readline("my_file.txt", keep=true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```

```julia-repl
julia> print("Enter your name: ")
Enter your name:

julia> your_name = readline()
Logan
"Logan"
```
```
readlines(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readlines(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read all lines of an I/O stream or a file as a vector of strings. Behavior is equivalent to saving the result of reading [`readline`](@ref) repeatedly with the same arguments and saving the resulting lines as a vector of strings.  See also [`eachline`](@ref) to iterate over the lines without reading them all at once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readlines("my_file.txt")
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."
 "It has many members."

julia> readlines("my_file.txt", keep=true)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"
 "It has many members.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
readlink(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Return the target location a symbolic link `path` points to.
```
readuntil(stream::IO, delim; keep::Bool = false)
readuntil(filename::AbstractString, delim; keep::Bool = false)
```

Read a string from an I/O stream or a file, up to the given delimiter. The delimiter can be a `UInt8`, `AbstractChar`, string, or vector. Keyword argument `keep` controls whether the delimiter is included in the result. The text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", 'L')
"Julia"

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", '.', keep = true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
real(z)
```

Return the real part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`imag`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`complex`](@ref), [`isreal`](@ref), [`Real`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(1 + 3im)
1
```

```
real(T::Type)
```

Return the type that represents the real part of a value of type `T`. e.g: for `T == Complex{R}`, returns `R`. Equivalent to `typeof(real(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(Complex{Int})
Int64

julia> real(Float64)
Float64
```

```
real(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the real part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `real.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0
 3

julia> real(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
2
```
```
realpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Canonicalize a path by expanding symbolic links and removing "." and ".." entries. On case-insensitive case-preserving filesystems (typically Mac and Windows), the filesystem's stored case for the path is returned.

(This function throws an exception if `path` does not exist in the filesystem.)

Boolean type, containing the values `true` and `false`.

`Bool` is a kind of number: `false` is numerically equal to `0` and `true` is numerically equal to `1`. Moreover, `false` acts as a multiplicative "strong zero":

```jldoctest
julia> false == 0
true

julia> true == 1
true

```
redirect_stdio(;stdin=stdin, stderr=stderr, stdout=stdout)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`. Each argument must be an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


```
redirect_stdio(f; stdin=nothing, stderr=nothing, stdout=nothing)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`, call `f()` and restore each stream.

Possible values for each stream are:

  * `nothing` indicating the stream should not be redirected.
  * `path::AbstractString` redirecting the stream to the file at `path`.
  * `io` an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="stdout.txt", stderr="stderr.txt") do
           print("hello stdout")
           print(stderr, "hello stderr")
       end

julia> read("stdout.txt", String)
"hello stdout"

julia> read("stderr.txt", String)
"hello stderr"
```

# Edge cases

It is possible to pass the same argument to `stdout` and `stderr`:

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="log.txt", stderr="log.txt", stdin=devnull) do
    ...
end
```

However it is not supported to pass two distinct descriptors of the same file.

```julia-repl
julia> io1 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> io2 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io1, stderr=io2) # not suppored
```

Also the `stdin` argument may not be the same descriptor as `stdout` or `stderr`.

```julia-repl
julia> io = open(...)

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io, stdin=io) # not supported
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
redisplay(x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
redisplay(mime, x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

By default, the `redisplay` functions simply call [`display`](@ref). However, some display backends may override `redisplay` to modify an existing display of `x` (if any). Using `redisplay` is also a hint to the backend that `x` may be redisplayed several times, and the backend may choose to defer the display until (for example) the next interactive prompt.
```
reduce(op, itr; [init])
```

Reduce the given collection `itr` with the given binary operator `op`. If provided, the initial value `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

For empty collections, providing `init` will be necessary, except for some special cases (e.g. when `op` is one of `+`, `*`, `max`, `min`, `&`, `|`) when Julia can determine the neutral element of `op`.

Reductions for certain commonly-used operators may have special implementations, and should be used instead: `maximum(itr)`, `minimum(itr)`, `sum(itr)`, `prod(itr)`,  `any(itr)`, `all(itr)`.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation dependent. This means that you can't use non-associative operations like `-` because it is undefined whether `reduce(-,[1,2,3])` should be evaluated as `(1-2)-3` or `1-(2-3)`. Use [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

Some operations accumulate error. Parallelism will be easier if the reduction can be executed in groups. Future versions of Julia might change the algorithm. Note that the elements are not reordered if you use an ordered collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4])
24

julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4]; init=-1)
-24
```

```
reduce(f, A; dims=:, [init])
```

Reduce 2-argument function `f` along dimensions of `A`. `dims` is a vector specifying the dimensions to reduce, and the keyword argument `init` is the initial value to use in the reductions. For `+`, `*`, `max` and `min` the `init` argument is optional.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent; if you need a particular associativity, e.g. left-to-right, you should write your own loop or consider using [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref). See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=2)
4×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 13
 14
 15
 16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  8  12  16
```
```
reenable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Re-enable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function. Temporarily reverses the effect of [`disable_sigint`](@ref).
```
reim(z)
```

Return a tuple of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number `z`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim(1 + 3im)
(1, 3)
```

```
reim(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return a tuple of two arrays containing respectively the real and the imaginary part of each entry in `A`.

Equivalent to `(real.(A), imag.(A))`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying to represent the real part, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
([1, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4])

julia> reim(fill(2 - im))
(fill(2), fill(-1))
```
```
reinterpret(type, A)
```

Change the type-interpretation of a block of memory. For arrays, this constructs a view of the array with the same binary data as the given array, but with the specified element type. For example, `reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))` interprets the 4 bytes corresponding to `UInt32(7)` as a [`Float32`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))
1.0f-44

julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32[1 2 3 4 5])
1×5 reinterpret(Float32, ::Matrix{UInt32}):
 1.0f-45  3.0f-45  4.0f-45  6.0f-45  7.0f-45
```

```
reinterpret(reshape, T, A::AbstractArray{S}) -> B
```

Change the type-interpretation of `A` while consuming or adding a "channel dimension."

If `sizeof(T) = n*sizeof(S)` for `n>1`, `A`'s first dimension must be of size `n` and `B` lacks `A`'s first dimension. Conversely, if `sizeof(S) = n*sizeof(T)` for `n>1`, `B` gets a new first dimension of size `n`. The dimensionality is unchanged if `sizeof(T) == sizeof(S)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int}, A)    # the result is a vector
2-element reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int64}, ::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1 + 3im
 2 + 4im

julia> a = [(1,2,3), (4,5,6)]
2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}:
 (1, 2, 3)
 (4, 5, 6)

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Int, a)             # the result is a matrix
3×2 reinterpret(reshape, Int64, ::Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}) with eltype Int64:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6
```
```
relpath(path::AbstractString, startpath::AbstractString = ".") -> AbstractString
```

Return a relative filepath to `path` either from the current directory or from an optional start directory. This is a path computation: the filesystem is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of `path` or `startpath`.

On Windows, case sensitivity is applied to every part of the path except drive letters. If `path` and `startpath` refer to different drives, the absolute path of `path` is returned.
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
rem2pi(x, r::RoundingMode)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `2π`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - 2π*round(x/(2π),r)
```

without any intermediate rounding. This internally uses a high precision approximation of 2π, and so will give a more accurate result than `rem(x,2π,r)`

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is in the interval $[-π, π]$. This will generally be the most accurate result. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$ if `x` is positive,. or $[-2π, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval $[-2π, 0]$. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rem2pi(7pi/4, RoundNearest)
-0.7853981633974485

julia> rem2pi(7pi/4, RoundDown)
5.497787143782138
```
```
repeat(A::AbstractArray, counts::Integer...)
```

Construct an array by repeating array `A` a given number of times in each dimension, specified by `counts`.

See also: [`fill`](@ref), [`Iterators.repeated`](@ref), [`Iterators.cycle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 1
 2
 3

julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2, 3)
6×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
```

```
repeat(A::AbstractArray; inner=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)), outer=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)))
```

Construct an array by repeating the entries of `A`. The i-th element of `inner` specifies the number of times that the individual entries of the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. The i-th element of `outer` specifies the number of times that a slice along the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. If `inner` or `outer` are omitted, no repetition is performed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat(1:2, inner=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
 2

julia> repeat(1:2, outer=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:

 1  2  1  2  1  2
 3  4  3  4  3  4
 3  4  3  4  3  4
```

```
repeat(s::AbstractString, r::Integer)
```

Repeat a string `r` times. This can be written as `s^r`.

See also [`^`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat("ha", 3)
"hahaha"
```

```
repeat(c::AbstractChar, r::Integer) -> String
```

Repeat a character `r` times. This can equivalently be accomplished by calling [`c^r`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat('A', 3)
"AAA"
```
```
replace(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of collection `A` where, for each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, all occurrences of `old` are replaced by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total.

The element type of the result is chosen using promotion (see [`promote_type`](@ref)) based on the element type of `A` and on the types of the `new` values in pairs. If `count` is omitted and the element type of `A` is a `Union`, the element type of the result will not include singleton types which are replaced with values of a different type: for example, `Union{T,Missing}` will become `T` if `missing` is replaced.

See also [`replace!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`insert!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.

```
replace(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of `A` where each value `x` in `A` is replaced by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"

```

```
replace(s::AbstractString, pat=>r, [pat2=>r2, ...]; [count::Integer])
```

Search for the given pattern `pat` in `s`, and replace each occurrence with `r`. If `count` is provided, replace at most `count` occurrences. `pat` may be a single character, a vector or a set of characters, a string, or a regular expression. If `r` is a function, each occurrence is replaced with `r(s)` where `s` is the matched substring (when `pat` is a `AbstractPattern` or `AbstractString`) or character (when `pat` is an `AbstractChar` or a collection of `AbstractChar`). If `pat` is a regular expression and `r` is a [`SubstitutionString`](@ref), then capture group references in `r` are replaced with the corresponding matched text. To remove instances of `pat` from `string`, set `r` to the empty `String` (`""`).

Multiple patterns can be specified, and they will be applied left-to-right simultaneously, so only one pattern will be applied to any character, and the patterns will only be applied to the input text, not the replacements.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Support for multiple patterns requires version 1.7.


# Examples

```
```
replace!(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

For each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, replace all occurrences of `old` in collection `A` by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total. See also [`replace`](@ref replace(A, old_new::Pair...)).

Perform a compare-and-swap operation on `x.f` from `expected` to `desired`, per egal. The syntax `@atomic_replace! x.f expected => desired` can be used instead of the function call form.

See also [`replacefield!`](@ref Core.replacefield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
repr(x; context=nothing)
```

Create a string from any value using the [`show`](@ref) function. You should not add methods to `repr`; define a `show` method instead.

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

Note that `repr(x)` is usually similar to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.  See also [`repr(MIME("text/plain"), x)`](@ref) to instead return a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed more for human consumption, equivalent to the REPL display of `x`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repr(1)
"1"

julia> repr(zeros(3))
"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

julia> repr(big(1/3))
"0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125"

julia> repr(big(1/3), context=:compact => true)
"0.333333"

```

```
repr(mime, x; context=nothing)
```

Returns an `AbstractString` or `Vector{UInt8}` containing the representation of `x` in the requested `mime` type, as written by [`show(io, mime, x)`](@ref) (throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if no appropriate `show` is available). An `AbstractString` is returned for MIME types with textual representations (such as `"text/html"` or `"application/postscript"`), whereas binary data is returned as `Vector{UInt8}`. (The function `istextmime(mime)` returns whether or not Julia treats a given `mime` type as text.)

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to `:key=>value` pair or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

As a special case, if `x` is an `AbstractString` (for textual MIME types) or a `Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types), the `repr` function assumes that `x` is already in the requested `mime` format and simply returns `x`. This special case does not apply to the `"text/plain"` MIME type. This is useful so that raw data can be passed to `display(m::MIME, x)`.

In particular, `repr("text/plain", x)` is typically a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed for human consumption.  See also [`repr(x)`](@ref) to instead return a string corresponding to [`show(x)`](@ref) that may be closer to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> repr("text/plain", A)
"2×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2\n 3  4"
```
```
reset(s::IO)
```

Reset a stream `s` to a previously marked position, and remove the mark. Return the previously marked position. Throw an error if the stream is not marked.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`unmark`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).

```
reset(::Event)
```

Reset an Event back into an un-set state. Then any future calls to `wait` will block until `notify` is called again.
```
reshape(A, dims...) -> AbstractArray
reshape(A, dims) -> AbstractArray
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with different dimension sizes or number of dimensions. The two arrays share the same underlying data, so that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

The new dimensions may be specified either as a list of arguments or as a shape tuple. At most one dimension may be specified with a `:`, in which case its length is computed such that its product with all the specified dimensions is equal to the length of the original array `A`. The total number of elements must not change.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:16)
16-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6

julia> reshape(1:6, 2, 3)
2×3 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 2, 3) with eltype Int64:
 1  3  5
 2  4  6
```
```
resize!(a::Vector, n::Integer) -> Vector
```

Resize `a` to contain `n` elements. If `n` is smaller than the current collection length, the first `n` elements will be retained. If `n` is larger, the new elements are not guaranteed to be initialized.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> resize!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 5
 4

julia> a = resize!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 8);

julia> length(a)
8

julia> a[1:6]
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
rethrow()
```

Rethrow the current exception from within a `catch` block. The rethrown exception will continue propagation as if it had not been caught.

!!! note
    The alternative form `rethrow(e)` allows you to associate an alternative exception object `e` with the current backtrace. However this misrepresents the program state at the time of the error so you're encouraged to instead throw a new exception using `throw(e)`. In Julia 1.1 and above, using `throw(e)` will preserve the root cause exception on the stack, as described in [`current_exceptions`](@ref).

```
retry(f;  delays=ExponentialBackOff(), check=nothing) -> Function
```

Return an anonymous function that calls function `f`.  If an exception arises, `f` is repeatedly called again, each time `check` returns `true`, after waiting the number of seconds specified in `delays`.  `check` should input `delays`'s current state and the `Exception`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Before Julia 1.2 this signature was restricted to `f::Function`.


# Examples

```julia
retry(f, delays=fill(5.0, 3))
retry(f, delays=rand(5:10, 2))
retry(f, delays=Base.ExponentialBackOff(n=3, first_delay=5, max_delay=1000))
retry(http_get, check=(s,e)->e.status == "503")(url)
retry(read, check=(s,e)->isa(e, IOError))(io, 128; all=false)
```
```
reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )
```

Return a copy of `v` reversed from start to stop.  See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy, and in-place [`reverse!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse(A)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 4

julia> reverse(A, 1, 4)
5-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> reverse(A, 3, 5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 5
 4
 3
```

```
reverse(A; dims=:)
```

Reverse `A` along dimension `dims`, which can be an integer (a single dimension), a tuple of integers (a tuple of dimensions) or `:` (reverse along all the dimensions, the default).  See also [`reverse!`](@ref) for in-place reversal.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = Int64[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reverse(b, dims=2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 4  3

julia> reverse(b)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Prior to Julia 1.6, only single-integer `dims` are supported in `reverse`.


```
reverse(s::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Reverses a string. Technically, this function reverses the codepoints in a string and its main utility is for reversed-order string processing, especially for reversed regular-expression searches. See also [`reverseind`](@ref) to convert indices in `s` to indices in `reverse(s)` and vice-versa, and `graphemes` from module `Unicode` to operate on user-visible "characters" (graphemes) rather than codepoints. See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy. Custom string types must implement the `reverse` function themselves and should typically return a string with the same type and encoding. If they return a string with a different encoding, they must also override `reverseind` for that string type to satisfy `s[reverseind(s,i)] == reverse(s)[i]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("JuliaLang")
"gnaLailuJ"
```

!!! note
    The examples below may be rendered differently on different systems. The comments indicate how they're supposed to be rendered


Combining characters can lead to surprising results:

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("ax̂e") # hat is above x in the input, above e in the output
"êxa"

julia> using Unicode

julia> join(reverse(collect(graphemes("ax̂e")))) # reverses graphemes; hat is above x in both in- and output
"ex̂a"
```

```
reverse(o::Base.Ordering)
```

reverses ordering specified by `o`.
```
reverse!(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]]) -> v
```

In-place version of [`reverse`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse!(A);

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
reverse!(A; dims=:)
```

Like [`reverse`](@ref), but operates in-place in `A`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Multidimensional `reverse!` requires Julia 1.6.

```
reverseind(v, i)
```

Given an index `i` in [`reverse(v)`](@ref), return the corresponding index in `v` so that `v[reverseind(v,i)] == reverse(v)[i]`. (This can be nontrivial in cases where `v` contains non-ASCII characters.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = "Julia🚀"
"Julia🚀"

julia> r = reverse(s)
"🚀ailuJ"

julia> for i in eachindex(s)
           print(r[reverseind(r, i)])
       end
Julia🚀
```
```
rm(path::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, recursive::Bool=false)
```

Delete the file, link, or empty directory at the given path. If `force=true` is passed, a non-existing path is not treated as error. If `recursive=true` is passed and the path is a directory, then all contents are removed recursively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> rm("my", recursive=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist", force=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist")
ERROR: IOError: unlink("this_file_does_not_exist"): no such file or directory (ENOENT)

```
```
rot180(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

```
rot180(A, k)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is even, this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a,1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

 2  1

julia> rot180(a,2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
rotl90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` left 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  4
 1  3
```

```
rotl90(A, k)
```

Left-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees counterclockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a,1)

```
```
rotr90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` right 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotr90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  1
 4  2
```

```
rotr90(A, k)
```

Right-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees clockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]])
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; digits=, base=10)
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; sigdigits=, base=10)
```

Return the nearest integral value of the same type as the complex-valued `z` to `z`, breaking ties using the specified [`RoundingMode`](@ref)s. The first [`RoundingMode`](@ref) is used for rounding the real components while the second is used for rounding the imaginary components.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> round(3.14 + 4.5im)
3.0 + 4.0im
```

```
round([T,] x, [r::RoundingMode])
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; digits::Integer=0, base = 10)
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; sigdigits::Integer, base = 10)
```

Rounds the number `x`.

Without keyword arguments, `x` is rounded to an integer value, returning a value of type `T`, or of the same type of `x` if no `T` is provided. An [`InexactError`](@ref) will be thrown if the value is not representable by `T`, similar to [`convert`](@ref).

If the `digits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of digits after the decimal place (or before if negative), in base `base`.

If the `sigdigits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of significant digits, in base `base`.

The [`RoundingMode`](@ref) `r` controls the direction of the rounding; the default is [`RoundNearest`](@ref), which rounds to the nearest integer, with ties (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer. Note that `round` may give incorrect results if the global rounding mode is changed (see [`rounding`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(1.7)
2.0

julia> round(Int, 1.7)
2

julia> round(1.5)
2.0

julia> round(2.5)
2.0

julia> round(pi; digits=2)
3.14

julia> round(pi; digits=3, base=2)
3.125

julia> round(123.456; sigdigits=2)
120.0

julia> round(357.913; sigdigits=4, base=2)
352.0
```

!!! note
    Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when operating on binary floating point numbers. For example, the [`Float64`](@ref) value represented by `1.15` is actually *less* than 1.15, yet will be rounded to 1.2. For example:

    ```jldoctest; setup = :(using Printf)
    julia> x = 1.15
    1.15

    julia> @sprintf "%.20f" x
    "1.14999999999999991118"

    julia> x < 115//100
    true

    julia> round(x, digits=1)
    1.2
    ```


# Extensions

To extend `round` to new numeric types, it is typically sufficient to define `Base.round(x::NewType, r::RoundingMode)`.

```
round(dt::TimeType, p::Period, [r::RoundingMode]) -> TimeType
```

Return the `Date` or `DateTime` nearest to `dt` at resolution `p`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 9:30 to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `round(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> round(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> round(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::TimeType, ::Period, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

```
round(x::Period, precision::T, [r::RoundingMode]) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 90 minutes to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `round(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> round(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> round(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::Period, ::T, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
rounding(T)
```

Get the current floating point rounding mode for type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion.

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available modes.
```
rpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the right with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rpad("March", 20)
"March               "
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
rsplit(s::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
rsplit(s::AbstractString, chars; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
```

Similar to [`split`](@ref), but starting from the end of the string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "M.a.r.c.h"
"M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, ".")
5-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M"
 "a"
 "r"
 "c"
 "h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=1)
1-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=2)
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c"
 "h"
```
```
rstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
rstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`lstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = rpad("March", 20)
"March               "

julia> rstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
run(command, args...; wait::Bool = true)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual). Throws an error if anything goes wrong, including the process exiting with a non-zero status (when `wait` is true).

The `args...` allow you to pass through file descriptors to the command, and are ordered like regular unix file descriptors (eg `stdin, stdout, stderr, FD(3), FD(4)...`).

If `wait` is false, the process runs asynchronously. You can later wait for it and check its exit status by calling `success` on the returned process object.

When `wait` is false, the process' I/O streams are directed to `devnull`. When `wait` is true, I/O streams are shared with the parent process. Use [`pipeline`](@ref) to control I/O redirection.
No documentation found.

Binding `samefile` does not exist.
```
schedule(t::Task, [val]; error=false)
```

Add a [`Task`](@ref) to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly when the system is otherwise idle, unless the task performs a blocking operation such as [`wait`](@ref).

If a second argument `val` is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the return value of [`yieldto`](@ref)) when it runs again. If `error` is `true`, the value is raised as an exception in the woken task.

!!! warning
    It is incorrect to use `schedule` on an arbitrary `Task` that has already been started. See [the API reference](@ref low-level-schedule-wait) for more information.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a5() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a5);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
true

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
searchsorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the range of indices of `a` which compare as equal to `x` (using binary search) according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order. Return an empty range located at the insertion point if `a` does not contain values equal to `x`.

See also: [`insorted`](@ref), [`searchsortedfirst`](@ref), [`sort`](@ref), [`findall`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3:3

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4:5

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3:2

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7:6

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1:0
```
```
searchsortedfirst(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the first value in `a` greater than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `lastindex(a) + 1` if `x` is greater than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

See also: [`searchsortedlast`](@ref), [`searchsorted`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3

1
```
```
searchsortedlast(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the last value in `a` less than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `firstindex(a) - 1` if `x` is less than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
5

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
2

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
6

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
0
```
```

sec(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix secant of a square matrix `A`.
```
secd(x)
```

Compute the secant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
sech(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic secant of `x`.

```

seek(s, pos)
```

Seek a stream to the given position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
seekend(s)
```

Seek a stream to its end.
```
seekstart(s)
```

Seek a stream to its beginning.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> seekstart(io);

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
selectdim(A, d::Integer, i)
```

Return a view of all the data of `A` where the index for dimension `d` equals `i`.

Equivalent to `view(A,:,:,...,i,:,:,...)` where `i` is in position `d`.

See also: [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8]
2×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3) with eltype Int64:
 3
 7

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3:4)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3:4) with eltype Int64:
 3  4
 7  8
```
```
set_zero_subnormals(yes::Bool) -> Bool
```

If `yes` is `false`, subsequent floating-point operations follow rules for IEEE arithmetic on subnormal values ("denormals"). Otherwise, floating-point operations are permitted (but not required) to convert subnormal inputs or outputs to zero. Returns `true` unless `yes==true` but the hardware does not support zeroing of subnormal numbers.

`set_zero_subnormals(true)` can speed up some computations on some hardware. However, it can break identities such as `(x-y==0) == (x==y)`.

!!! warning
    This function only affects the current thread.

```
setcpuaffinity(original_command::Cmd, cpus) -> command::Cmd
```

Set the CPU affinity of the `command` by a list of CPU IDs (1-based) `cpus`.  Passing `cpus = nothing` means to unset the CPU affinity if the `original_command` has any.

This function is supported only in Linux and Windows.  It is not supported in macOS because libuv does not support affinity setting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

In Linux, the `taskset` command line program can be used to see how `setcpuaffinity` works.

```julia
julia> run(setcpuaffinity(`sh -c 'taskset -p $$'`, [1, 2, 5]));
pid 2273's current affinity mask: 13
```

Note that the mask value `13` reflects that the first, second, and the fifth bits (counting from the least significant position) are turned on:

```julia
julia> 0b010011
0x13
```
```
setdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set of elements in `s` but not in any of the iterables in `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

See also [`setdiff!`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> setdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
setdiff!(s, itrs...)
```

Remove from set `s` (in-place) each element of each iterable from `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([1, 3, 4, 5]);

julia> setdiff!(a, 1:2:6);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  4
```
```
setenv(command::Cmd, env; dir)
```

Set environment variables to use when running the given `command`. `env` is either a dictionary mapping strings to strings, an array of strings of the form `"var=val"`, or zero or more `"var"=>val` pair arguments. In order to modify (rather than replace) the existing environment, create `env` through `copy(ENV)` and then setting `env["var"]=val` as desired, or use [`addenv`](@ref).

The `dir` keyword argument can be used to specify a working directory for the command. `dir` defaults to the currently set `dir` for `command` (which is the current working directory if not specified already).

See also [`Cmd`](@ref), [`addenv`](@ref), [`ENV`](@ref), [`pwd`](@ref).
```
setindex!(collection, value, key...)
```

Store the given value at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...] = x` is converted by the compiler to `(setindex!(a, x, i, j, ...); x)`.

```
setindex!(A, X, inds...)
A[inds...] = X
```

Store values from array `X` within some subset of `A` as specified by `inds`. The syntax `A[inds...] = X` is equivalent to `(setindex!(A, X, inds...); X)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,2);

julia> setindex!(A, [10, 20], [1, 2]);

julia> A[[3, 4]] = [30, 40];

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 10.0  30.0
 20.0  40.0
```
```
setprecision([T=BigFloat,] precision::Int; base=2)
```

Set the precision (in bits, by default) to be used for `T` arithmetic. If `base` is specified, then the precision is the minimum required to give at least `precision` digits in the given `base`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.


```
setprecision(f::Function, [T=BigFloat,] precision::Integer; base=2)
```

Change the `T` arithmetic precision (in the given `base`) for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = precision(BigFloat)
setprecision(BigFloat, precision)
f()
setprecision(BigFloat, old)
```

Often used as `setprecision(T, precision) do ... end`

Note: `nextfloat()`, `prevfloat()` do not use the precision mentioned by `setprecision`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x)
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b = c` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

See also [`setfield!`](@ref Core.setfield!), [`propertynames`](@ref Base.propertynames) and [`getproperty`](@ref Base.getproperty).
```
setrounding(T, mode)
```

Set the rounding mode of floating point type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion. Other numerical functions may give incorrect or invalid values when using rounding modes other than the default [`RoundNearest`](@ref).

Note that this is currently only supported for `T == BigFloat`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


```
setrounding(f::Function, T, mode)
```

Change the rounding mode of floating point type `T` for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = rounding(T)
setrounding(T, mode)
f()
setrounding(T, old)
```

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available rounding modes.
```
show([io::IO = stdout], x)
```

Write a text representation of a value `x` to the output stream `io`. New types `T` should overload `show(io::IO, x::T)`. The representation used by `show` generally includes Julia-specific formatting and type information, and should be parseable Julia code when possible.

[`repr`](@ref) returns the output of `show` as a string.

To customize human-readable text output for objects of type `T`, define `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` instead. Checking the `:compact` [`IOContext`](@ref) property of `io` in such methods is recommended, since some containers show their elements by calling this method with `:compact => true`.

See also [`print`](@ref), which writes un-decorated representations.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> show("Hello World!")
"Hello World!"
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```

```
show(io::IO, mime, x)
```

The [`display`](@ref) functions ultimately call `show` in order to write an object `x` as a given `mime` type to a given I/O stream `io` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary to define a new `show` method for `T`, via: `show(io, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`, where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls [`write`](@ref) (or similar) to write that representation of `x` to `io`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use `MIME{Symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function `show(io, ::MIME"image/png", x::MyImage) = ...` to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable `AbstractDisplay` (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to `import Base.show` in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function `show`.

Technically, the `MIME"mime"` macro defines a singleton type for the given `mime` string, which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any given type.

The default MIME type is `MIME"text/plain"`. There is a fallback definition for `text/plain` output that calls `show` with 2 arguments, so it is not always necessary to add a method for that case. If a type benefits from custom human-readable output though, `show(::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` should be defined. For example, the `Day` type uses `1 day` as the output for the `text/plain` MIME type, and `Day(1)` as the output of 2-argument `show`.

Container types generally implement 3-argument `show` by calling `show(io, MIME"text/plain"(), x)` for elements `x`, with `:compact => true` set in an [`IOContext`](@ref) passed as the first argument.
```
showable(mime, x)
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object `x` can be written as the given `mime` type.

(By default, this is determined automatically by the existence of the corresponding [`show`](@ref) method for `typeof(x)`.  Some types provide custom `showable` methods; for example, if the available MIME formats depend on the *value* of `x`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> showable(MIME("text/plain"), rand(5))
true

julia> showable("image/png", rand(5))
false
```
```
showerror(io, e)
```

Show a descriptive representation of an exception object `e`. This method is used to display the exception after a call to [`throw`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyException <: Exception
           msg::String
       end

julia> function Base.showerror(io::IO, err::MyException)
           print(io, "MyException: ")
           print(io, err.msg)
       end

julia> err = MyException("test exception")
MyException("test exception")

julia> sprint(showerror, err)
"MyException: test exception"

julia> throw(MyException("test exception"))
ERROR: MyException: test exception
```
```
sign(x)
```

Return zero if `x==0` and $x/|x|$ otherwise (i.e., ±1 for real `x`).

See also [`signbit`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref), [`copysign`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sign(-4.0)
-1.0

julia> sign(99)
1

julia> sign(-0.0)
-0.0

julia> sign(0 + im)
0.0 + 1.0im
```
```
signbit(x)
```

Returns `true` if the value of the sign of `x` is negative, otherwise `false`.

See also [`sign`](@ref) and [`copysign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signbit(-4)
true

julia> signbit(5)
false

julia> signbit(5.5)
false

julia> signbit(-4.1)
true
```
```
signed(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the signed type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signed(UInt16)
Int16
julia> signed(UInt64)
Int64
```

```
signed(x)
```

Convert a number to a signed integer. If the argument is unsigned, it is reinterpreted as signed without checking for overflow.

See also: [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).
```
significand(x)
```

Extract the significand (a.k.a. mantissa) of a floating-point number. If `x` is a non-zero finite number, then the result will be a number of the same type and sign as `x`, and whose absolute value is on the interval $[1,2)$. Otherwise `x` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> significand(15.2)
1.9

julia> significand(-15.2)
-1.9

julia> significand(-15.2) * 2^3
-15.2

julia> significand(-Inf), significand(Inf), significand(NaN)
(-Inf, Inf, NaN)
```
```
similar(array, [element_type=eltype(array)], [dims=size(array)])
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array with the given element type and size, based upon the given source array. The second and third arguments are both optional, defaulting to the given array's `eltype` and `size`. The dimensions may be specified either as a single tuple argument or as a series of integer arguments.

Custom AbstractArray subtypes may choose which specific array type is best-suited to return for the given element type and dimensionality. If they do not specialize this method, the default is an `Array{element_type}(undef, dims...)`.

For example, `similar(1:10, 1, 4)` returns an uninitialized `Array{Int,2}` since ranges are neither mutable nor support 2 dimensions:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(1:10, 1, 4)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4419743872  4374413872  4419743888  0
```

Conversely, `similar(trues(10,10), 2)` returns an uninitialized `BitVector` with two elements since `BitArray`s are both mutable and can support 1-dimensional arrays:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(trues(10,10), 2)
2-element BitVector:
 0
 0
```

Since `BitArray`s can only store elements of type [`Bool`](@ref), however, if you request a different element type it will create a regular `Array` instead:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(falses(10), Float64, 2, 4)
2×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
```

See also: [`undef`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

```
similar(storagetype, axes)
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array analogous to that specified by `storagetype`, but with `axes` specified by the last argument.

**Examples**:

```
similar(Array{Int}, axes(A))
```

creates an array that "acts like" an `Array{Int}` (and might indeed be backed by one), but which is indexed identically to `A`. If `A` has conventional indexing, this will be identical to `Array{Int}(undef, size(A))`, but if `A` has unconventional indexing then the indices of the result will match `A`.

```
similar(BitArray, (axes(A, 2),))
```

would create a 1-dimensional logical array whose indices match those of the columns of `A`.
```
sin(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`sind`], [`sinpi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
sin(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the sine. Otherwise, the sine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sin(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649
```
```
sinc(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x) / (\pi x)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $1$ if $x = 0$.

See also [`cosc`](@ref), its derivative.
```
sincos(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians, returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

See also [`cis`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref).

```
sincos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine and cosine of a square matrix `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> S, C = sincos(fill(1.0, (2,2)));

julia> S
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649

julia> C
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
sincosd(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
sincospi(x)
```

Simultaneously compute [`sinpi(x)`](@ref) and [`cospi(x)`](@ref) (the sine and cosine of `π*x`, where `x` is in radians), returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.


See also: [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref), [`sinpi`](@ref).
```
sind(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
sinh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic sine of `x`.

```
sinh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic sine of a square matrix `A`.
```
sinpi(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x)$ more accurately than `sin(pi*x)`, especially for large `x`.

See also [`sind`](@ref), [`cospi`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref).
```
size(A::AbstractArray, [dim])
```

Return a tuple containing the dimensions of `A`. Optionally you can specify a dimension to just get the length of that dimension.

Note that `size` may not be defined for arrays with non-standard indices, in which case [`axes`](@ref) may be useful. See the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

See also: [`length`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`sizeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (2,3,4));

julia> size(A)
(2, 3, 4)

julia> size(A, 2)
3
```
```
sizehint!(s, n)
```

Suggest that collection `s` reserve capacity for at least `n` elements. This can improve performance.

# Notes on the performance model

For types that support `sizehint!`,

1. `push!` and `append!` methods generally may (but are not required to) preallocate extra storage. For types implemented in `Base`, they typically do, using a heuristic optimized for a general use case.
2. `sizehint!` may control this preallocation. Again, it typically does this for types in `Base`.
3. `empty!` is nearly costless (and O(1)) for types that support this kind of preallocation.
```
sizeof(T::DataType)
sizeof(obj)
```

Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given `DataType` `T`, if any. Or the size, in bytes, of object `obj` if it is not a `DataType`.

See also [`summarysize`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(Float32)
4

julia> sizeof(ComplexF64)
16

julia> sizeof(1.0)
8

julia> sizeof(collect(1.0:10.0))
80
```

If `DataType` `T` does not have a specific size, an error is thrown.

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(AbstractArray)
ERROR: Abstract type AbstractArray does not have a definite size.
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
sizeof(str::AbstractString)
```

Size, in bytes, of the string `str`. Equal to the number of code units in `str` multiplied by the size, in bytes, of one code unit in `str`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof("")
0

julia> sizeof("∀")
3
```
```
skip(s, offset)
```

Seek a stream relative to the current position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> skip(io, 10);

julia> read(io, Char)
'G': ASCII/Unicode U+0047 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
skipchars(predicate, io::IO; linecomment=nothing)
```

Advance the stream `io` such that the next-read character will be the first remaining for which `predicate` returns `false`. If the keyword argument `linecomment` is specified, all characters from that character until the start of the next line are ignored.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> buf = IOBuffer("    text")
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> skipchars(isspace, buf)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=5, mark=-1)

julia> String(readavailable(buf))
"text"
```
```
skipmissing(itr)
```

Return an iterator over the elements in `itr` skipping [`missing`](@ref) values. The returned object can be indexed using indices of `itr` if the latter is indexable. Indices corresponding to missing values are not valid: they are skipped by [`keys`](@ref) and [`eachindex`](@ref), and a `MissingException` is thrown when trying to use them.

Use [`collect`](@ref) to obtain an `Array` containing the non-`missing` values in `itr`. Note that even if `itr` is a multidimensional array, the result will always be a `Vector` since it is not possible to remove missings while preserving dimensions of the input.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`ismissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = skipmissing([1, missing, 2])
skipmissing(Union{Missing, Int64}[1, missing, 2])

julia> sum(x)
3

julia> x[1]
1

julia> x[2]
ERROR: MissingException: the value at index (2,) is missing
[...]

julia> argmax(x)
3

julia> collect(keys(x))
2-element Vector{Int64}:

 1
 2

julia> collect(skipmissing([1 missing; 2 missing]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
sleep(seconds)
```

Block the current task for a specified number of seconds. The minimum sleep time is 1 millisecond or input of `0.001`.
```
something(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`nothing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise throw an error. Arguments of type [`Some`](@ref) are unwrapped.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`@something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> something(nothing, 1)
1

julia> something(Some(1), nothing)

julia> something(missing, nothing)
missing

julia> something(nothing, nothing)
ERROR: ArgumentError: No value arguments present
```
```
sort(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Variant of [`sort!`](@ref) that returns a sorted copy of `v` leaving `v` itself unmodified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> sort(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 1
 2
```

```
sort(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort a multidimensional array `A` along the given dimension. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]

sort!(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the vector `v` in place. [`QuickSort`](@ref) is used by default for numeric arrays while [`MergeSort`](@ref) is used for other arrays. You can specify an algorithm to use via the `alg` keyword (see [Sorting Algorithms](@ref) for available algorithms). The `by` keyword lets you provide a function that will be applied to each element before comparison; the `lt` keyword allows providing a custom "less than" function (note that for every `x` and `y`, only one of `lt(x,y)` and `lt(y,x)` can return `true`); use `rev=true` to reverse the sorting order. These options are independent and can be used together in all possible combinations: if both `by` and `lt` are specified, the `lt` function is applied to the result of the `by` function; `rev=true` reverses whatever ordering specified via the `by` and `lt` keywords.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; sort!(v); v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; sort!(v, rev = true); v

julia> v = [(1, "c"), (3, "a"), (2, "b")]; sort!(v, by = x -> x[1]); v
3-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, String}}:

 (2, "b")
 (3, "a")

julia> v = [(1, "c"), (3, "a"), (2, "b")]; sort!(v, by = x -> x[2]); v

```

```
sort!(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=defalg(A), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the multidimensional array `A` along dimension `dims`. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort!(A, dims = 1); A

```
```
sortperm(v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Return a permutation vector `I` that puts `v[I]` in sorted order. The order is specified using the same keywords as [`sort!`](@ref). The permutation is guaranteed to be stable even if the sorting algorithm is unstable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

See also [`sortperm!`](@ref), [`partialsortperm`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref), [`indexin`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> p = sortperm(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortperm!(ix, v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward, initialized::Bool=false)
```

Like [`sortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix`.  If `initialized` is `false` (the default), `ix` is initialized to contain the values `1:length(v)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; p = zeros(Int, 3);

julia> sortperm!(p, v); p
3-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortslices(A; dims, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort slices of an array `A`. The required keyword argument `dims` must be either an integer or a tuple of integers. It specifies the dimension(s) over which the slices are sorted.

E.g., if `A` is a matrix, `dims=1` will sort rows, `dims=2` will sort columns. Note that the default comparison function on one dimensional slices sorts lexicographically.

For the remaining keyword arguments, see the documentation of [`sort!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1) # Sort rows
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1   6  4
  7   3  5
  9  -2  8

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5
 -1   6  4

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, rev=true)
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2) # Sort columns
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  3   5  7
 -1  -4  6
 -2   8  9

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, alg=InsertionSort, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  5   3  7
 -4  -1  6

 7   5   3
 6  -4  -1
 9   8  -2
```

# Higher dimensions

`sortslices` extends naturally to higher dimensions. E.g., if `A` is a a 2x2x2 array, `sortslices(A, dims=3)` will sort slices within the 3rd dimension, passing the 2x2 slices `A[:, :, 1]` and `A[:, :, 2]` to the comparison function. Note that while there is no default order on higher-dimensional slices, you may use the `by` or `lt` keyword argument to specify such an order.

If `dims` is a tuple, the order of the dimensions in `dims` is relevant and specifies the linear order of the slices. E.g., if `A` is three dimensional and `dims` is `(1, 2)`, the orderings of the first two dimensions are re-arranged such that the slices (of the remaining third dimension) are sorted. If `dims` is `(2, 1)` instead, the same slices will be taken, but the result order will be row-major instead.

# Higher dimensional examples

splice!(a::Vector, index::Integer, [replacement]) -> item
```

Remove the item at the given index, and return the removed item. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gap. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed item.

See also: [`replace`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`pop!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; splice!(A, 5)

 -1
```

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

```
splice!(a::Vector, indices, [replacement]) -> items
```

Remove items at specified indices, and return a collection containing the removed items. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gaps. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed items; in this case, `indices` must be a `AbstractUnitRange`.

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Prior to Julia 1.5, `indices` must always be a `UnitRange`.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Prior to Julia 1.8, `indices` must be a `UnitRange` if splicing in replacement values.


# Examples

```
```
split(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
split(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` into an array of substrings on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm`.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`rsplit`](@ref), [`eachsplit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> split(a, ".")
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
splitdir(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

Split a path into a tuple of the directory name and file name.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitdir("/home/myuser")
("/home", "myuser")
```
```
splitdrive(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

On Windows, split a path into the drive letter part and the path part. On Unix systems, the first component is always the empty string.
```
splitext(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

If the last component of a path contains one or more dots, split the path into everything before the last dot and everything including and after the dot. Otherwise, return a tuple of the argument unmodified and the empty string. "splitext" is short for "split extension".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.jl")
("/home/myuser/example", ".jl")

julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.tar.gz")
("/home/myuser/example.tar", ".gz")

julia> splitext("/home/my.user/example")
("/home/my.user/example", "")
```
```
splitpath(path::AbstractString) -> Vector{String}
```

Split a file path into all its path components. This is the opposite of `joinpath`. Returns an array of substrings, one for each directory or file in the path, including the root directory if present.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitpath("/home/myuser/example.jl")
4-element Vector{String}:
 "/"
 "home"
 "myuser"
 "example.jl"
```
```
sprint(f::Function, args...; context=nothing, sizehint=0)
```

Call the given function with an I/O stream and the supplied extra arguments. Everything written to this I/O stream is returned as a string. `context` can be an [`IOContext`](@ref) whose properties will be used, a `Pair` specifying a property and its value, or a tuple of `Pair` specifying multiple properties and their values. `sizehint` suggests the capacity of the buffer (in bytes).

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `f`.  The optional `sizehint` is a suggested size (in bytes) to allocate for the buffer used to write the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sprint(show, 66.66666; context=:compact => true)
"66.6667"

julia> sprint(showerror, BoundsError([1], 100))
"BoundsError: attempt to access 1-element Vector{Int64} at index [100]"
```
```
sqrt(x)
```

Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.

See also: [`hypot`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> sqrt(big(81))
9.0

julia> sqrt(big(-81))
ERROR: DomainError with -81.0:

```
sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

If `A` is real-symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root.   For such matrices, eigenvalues λ that appear to be slightly negative due to roundoff errors are treated as if they were zero. More precisely, matrices with all eigenvalues `≥ -rtol*(max |λ|)` are treated as semidefinite (yielding a Hermitian square root), with negative eigenvalues taken to be zero. `rtol` is a keyword argument to `sqrt` (in the Hermitian/real-symmetric case only) that defaults to machine precision scaled by `size(A,1)`.

Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor. If a real square root exists, then an extension of this method [^H87] that computes the real Schur form and then the real square root of the quasi-triangular factor is instead used.

Binding `stack` does not exist.
```
stacktrace([trace::Vector{Ptr{Cvoid}},] [c_funcs::Bool=false]) -> StackTrace
```

Returns a stack trace in the form of a vector of `StackFrame`s. (By default stacktrace doesn't return C functions, but this can be enabled.) When called without specifying a trace, `stacktrace` first calls `backtrace`.
```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with `prefix`. If `prefix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the first character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`endswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", "Julia")
true
```

```
startswith(prefix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument starts with `prefix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> startswith(y, prefix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(startswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `startswith(prefix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith_julia = startswith("Julia");

julia> startswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> startswith_julia("NotJulia")
false
```

```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with the regex pattern, `prefix`.

!!! note
    `startswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"^...", s)` is faster than `startswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`endswith`](@ref).

    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

stat(file)
```

Returns a structure whose fields contain information about the file. The fields of the structure are:

```
step(r)
```

Get the step size of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) object.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> step(1:10)
1

julia> step(1:2:10)
2

julia> step(2.5:0.3:10.9)
0.3

julia> step(range(2.5, stop=10.9, length=85))
0.1
```
```
stride(A, k::Integer)
```

Return the distance in memory (in number of elements) between adjacent elements in dimension `k`.

See also: [`strides`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> stride(A,2)
3

julia> stride(A,3)
12
```
```
strides(A)
```

Return a tuple of the memory strides in each dimension.

See also: [`stride`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> strides(A)
(1, 3, 12)
```
```
string(n::Integer; base::Integer = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Convert an integer `n` to a string in the given `base`, optionally specifying a number of digits to pad to.

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string(5, base = 13, pad = 4)
"0005"

julia> string(-13, base = 5, pad = 4)
"-0023"
```

```
string(xs...)
```

Create a string from any values using the [`print`](@ref) function.

`string` should usually not be defined directly. Instead, define a method `print(io::IO, x::MyType)`. If `string(x)` for a certain type needs to be highly efficient, then it may make sense to add a method to `string` and define `print(io::IO, x::MyType) = print(io, string(x))` to ensure the functions are consistent.

See also: [`String`](@ref), [`repr`](@ref), [`sprint`](@ref), [`show`](@ref @show).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string("a", 1, true)
"a1true"
```
```
strip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
strip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading and trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading and trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, vector or set of characters.

See also [`lstrip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The method which accepts a predicate function requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strip("{3, 5}\n", ['{', '}', '\n'])
"3, 5"
```
```
success(command)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual), and tell whether it was successful (exited with a code of 0). An exception is raised if the process cannot be started.
```
sum(f, itr; [init])
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
29
```

Note the important difference between `sum(A)` and `reduce(+, A)` for arrays with small integer eltype:

```jldoctest
julia> sum(Int8[100, 28])
128

julia> reduce(+, Int8[100, 28])
-128
```

In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is 128. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in -128.

```
sum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the sum of all elements in a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  6

julia> sum(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 3
 7
```

```
sum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum(abs2, A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 10  20

julia> sum(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  5
 25
```
```
sum!(r, A)
```

Sum elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum!([1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 7

julia> sum!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  6
```
```
summary(io::IO, x)
str = summary(x)
```

Print to a stream `io`, or return a string `str`, giving a brief description of a value. By default returns `string(typeof(x))`, e.g. [`Int64`](@ref).

For arrays, returns a string of size and type info, e.g. `10-element Array{Int64,1}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> summary(1)
"Int64"

julia> summary(zeros(2))
"2-element Vector{Float64}"
```
```
supertype(T::DataType)
```

Return the supertype of DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> supertype(Int32)
Signed
```
```
swapproperty!(x, f::Symbol, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic a.b, _ = c, a.b` returns `(c, swapproperty!(a, :b, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where there must be one getfield expression common to both sides.

See also [`swapfield!`](@ref Core.swapfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
symdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of elements in the passed in sets. When `s` is not an `AbstractSet`, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.

See also [`symdiff!`](@ref), [`setdiff`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> symdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5], [4,5,6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> symdiff([1,2,1], [2, 1, 2])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> symdiff(unique([1,2,1]), unique([2, 1, 2]))
Int64[]
```
```
symdiff!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of the passed in sets, and overwrite `s` with the result. When `s` is an array, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.
```
symlink(target::AbstractString, link::AbstractString; dir_target = false)
```

Creates a symbolic link to `target` with the name `link`.

On Windows, symlinks must be explicitly declared as referring to a directory or not.  If `target` already exists, by default the type of `link` will be auto- detected, however if `target` does not exist, this function defaults to creating a file symlink unless `dir_target` is set to `true`.  Note that if the user sets `dir_target` but `target` exists and is a file, a directory symlink will still be created, but dereferencing the symlink will fail, just as if the user creates a file symlink (by calling `symlink()` with `dir_target` set to `false` before the directory is created) and tries to dereference it to a directory.

Additionally, there are two methods of making a link on Windows; symbolic links and junction points.  Junction points are slightly more efficient, but do not support relative paths, so if a relative directory symlink is requested (as denoted by `isabspath(target)` returning `false`) a symlink will be used, else a junction point will be used.  Best practice for creating symlinks on Windows is to create them only after the files/directories they reference are already created.

See also: [`hardlink`](@ref).

!!! note
    This function raises an error under operating systems that do not support soft symbolic links, such as Windows XP.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The `dir_target` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.6.  Prior to this, symlinks to nonexistant paths on windows would always be file symlinks, and relative symlinks to directories were not supported.

```
systemerror(sysfunc[, errno::Cint=Libc.errno()])
systemerror(sysfunc, iftrue::Bool)
```

Raises a `SystemError` for `errno` with the descriptive string `sysfunc` if `iftrue` is `true`
```
take!(b::IOBuffer)
```

Obtain the contents of an `IOBuffer` as an array. Afterwards, the `IOBuffer` is reset to its initial state.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."
```

```
take!(c::Channel)
```

Remove and return a value from a [`Channel`](@ref). Blocks until data is available.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`put!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

```
take!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Fetch value(s) from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) `rr`, removing the value(s) in the process.
```
tan(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
tan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the tangent. Otherwise, the tangent is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tan(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 -1.09252  -1.09252
 -1.09252  -1.09252
```
```
tand(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
tanh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
tanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic tangent of a square matrix `A`.
```
task_local_storage(key)
```

Look up the value of a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(key, value)
```

Assign a value to a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(body, key, value)
```

Call the function `body` with a modified task-local storage, in which `value` is assigned to `key`; the previous value of `key`, or lack thereof, is restored afterwards. Useful for emulating dynamic scoping.
```
tempdir()
```

Gets the path of the temporary directory. On Windows, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMP`, `TEMP`, `USERPROFILE`. On all other operating systems, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, and `TEMPDIR`. If none of these are found, the path `"/tmp"` is used.
```
tempname(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> String
```

Generate a temporary file path. This function only returns a path; no file is created. The path is likely to be unique, but this cannot be guaranteed due to the very remote posibility of two simultaneous calls to `tempname` generating the same file name. The name is guaranteed to differ from all files already existing at the time of the call to `tempname`.

When called with no arguments, the temporary name will be an absolute path to a temporary name in the system temporary directory as given by `tempdir()`. If a `parent` directory argument is given, the temporary path will be in that directory instead.

The `cleanup` option controls whether the process attempts to delete the returned path automatically when the process exits. Note that the `tempname` function does not create any file or directory at the returned location, so there is nothing to cleanup unless you create a file or directory there. If you do and `clean` is `true` it will be deleted upon process termination.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `parent` and `cleanup` arguments were added in 1.4. Prior to Julia 1.4 the path `tempname` would never be cleaned up at process termination.


!!! warning
    This can lead to security holes if another process obtains the same file name and creates the file before you are able to. Open the file with `JL_O_EXCL` if this is a concern. Using [`mktemp()`](@ref) is also recommended instead.

```
textwidth(c)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth('α')
1

julia> textwidth('⛵')
2
```

```
textwidth(s::AbstractString)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth("March")
5
```
```
thisind(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Int
```

If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding code unit `i` is part of. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return `i`; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to 0 or `ncodeunits(s)+1` return `i`. In all other cases throw `BoundsError`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> thisind("α", 0)
0

julia> thisind("α", 1)
1

julia> thisind("α", 2)
1

julia> thisind("α", 3)
3

julia> thisind("α", 4)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [4]
[...]

julia> thisind("α", -1)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [-1]
[...]
```
```
time(t::TmStruct)
```

Converts a `TmStruct` struct to a number of seconds since the epoch.

```
time()
```

Get the system time in seconds since the epoch, with fairly high (typically, microsecond) resolution.
```
time_ns()
```

Get the time in nanoseconds. The time corresponding to 0 is undefined, and wraps every 5.8 years.
```
timedwait(callback::Function, timeout::Real; pollint::Real=0.1)
```

Waits until `callback` returns `true` or `timeout` seconds have passed, whichever is earlier. `callback` is polled every `pollint` seconds. The minimum value for `timeout` and `pollint` is `0.001`, that is, 1 millisecond.

Returns :ok or :timed_out
```
titlecase(s::AbstractString; [wordsep::Function], strict::Bool=true) -> String
```

Capitalize the first character of each word in `s`; if `strict` is true, every other character is converted to lowercase, otherwise they are left unchanged. By default, all non-letters beginning a new grapheme are considered as word separators; a predicate can be passed as the `wordsep` keyword to determine which characters should be considered as word separators. See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref) to capitalize only the first character in `s`.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> titlecase("the JULIA programming language")
"The Julia Programming Language"

julia> titlecase("ISS - international space station", strict=false)
"ISS - International Space Station"

julia> titlecase("a-a b-b", wordsep = c->c==' ')
"A-a B-b"
```
```
to_indices(A, I::Tuple)
```

Convert the tuple `I` to a tuple of indices for use in indexing into array `A`.

The returned tuple must only contain either `Int`s or `AbstractArray`s of scalar indices that are supported by array `A`. It will error upon encountering a novel index type that it does not know how to process.

For simple index types, it defers to the unexported `Base.to_index(A, i)` to process each index `i`. While this internal function is not intended to be called directly, `Base.to_index` may be extended by custom array or index types to provide custom indexing behaviors.

More complicated index types may require more context about the dimension into which they index. To support those cases, `to_indices(A, I)` calls `to_indices(A, axes(A), I)`, which then recursively walks through both the given tuple of indices and the dimensional indices of `A` in tandem. As such, not all index types are guaranteed to propagate to `Base.to_index`.
```
touch(path::AbstractString)
```

Update the last-modified timestamp on a file to the current time.

If the file does not exist a new file is created.

Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> write("my_little_file", 2);

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.5273815391135583e9

julia> touch("my_little_file");

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.527381559163435e9
```

We can see the [`mtime`](@ref) has been modified by `touch`.
```
trailing_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_ones(3)
2
```
```
trailing_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_zeros(2)
1
```
```
transcode(T, src)
```

Convert string data between Unicode encodings. `src` is either a `String` or a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-XX code units, where `XX` is 8, 16, or 32. `T` indicates the encoding of the return value: `String` to return a (UTF-8 encoded) `String` or `UIntXX` to return a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-`XX` data. (The alias [`Cwchar_t`](@ref) can also be used as the integer type, for converting `wchar_t*` strings used by external C libraries.)

The `transcode` function succeeds as long as the input data can be reasonably represented in the target encoding; it always succeeds for conversions between UTF-XX encodings, even for invalid Unicode data.

Only conversion to/from UTF-8 is currently supported.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγ"
"αβγ"

julia> transcode(UInt16, str)
3-element Vector{UInt16}:
 0x03b1
 0x03b2
 0x03b3

julia> transcode(String, transcode(UInt16, str))
"αβγ"
```
```
transpose(A)
```

Lazy transpose. Mutating the returned object should appropriately mutate `A`. Often, but not always, yields `Transpose(A)`, where `Transpose` is a lazy transpose wrapper. Note that this operation is recursive.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3+2im  8+7im
 9+2im  4+6im
```
```
trues(dims)
```

Create a `BitArray` with all values set to `true`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trues(2,3)
2×3 BitMatrix:
 1  1  1
 1  1  1
```
```
trunc([T,] x)
trunc(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
trunc(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`trunc(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`.

`trunc(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

See also: [`%`](@ref rem), [`floor`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`unsafe_trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(2.22)
2.0

julia> trunc(-2.22, digits=1)
-2.2

julia> trunc(Int, -2.22)
-2
```

```
trunc(dt::TimeType, ::Type{Period}) -> TimeType
```

Truncates the value of `dt` according to the provided `Period` type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(Dates.DateTime("1996-01-01T12:30:00"), Dates.Day)
1996-01-01T00:00:00
```
```
truncate(file, n)
```

Resize the file or buffer given by the first argument to exactly `n` bytes, filling previously unallocated space with '\0' if the file or buffer is grown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.")
35

julia> truncate(io, 15)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=15, maxsize=Inf, ptr=16, mark=-1)

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a "

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> truncate(io, 40);

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\0\0\0\0\0"
```
```
trylock(lock) -> Success (Boolean)
```

Acquire the lock if it is available, and return `true` if successful. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, return `false`.

Each successful `trylock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).
```
tryparse(type, str; base)
```

Like [`parse`](@ref), but returns either a value of the requested type, or [`nothing`](@ref) if the string does not contain a valid number.
```
typeintersect(T::Type, S::Type)
```

Compute a type that contains the intersection of `T` and `S`. Usually this will be the smallest such type or one close to it.
```
typejoin(T, S)
```

Return the closest common ancestor of `T` and `S`, i.e. the narrowest type from which they both inherit.
```
typemax(T)
```

The highest value representable by the given (real) numeric `DataType`.

See also: [`floatmax`](@ref), [`typemin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemax(Int8)
127

julia> typemax(UInt32)
0xffffffff

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf

julia> floatmax(Float32)  # largest finite floating point number
3.4028235f38
```
```
typemin(T)
```

The lowest value representable by the given (real) numeric DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemin(Float16)
-Inf16

julia> typemin(Float32)
-Inf32
```
```
unescape_string(str::AbstractString, keep = ())::AbstractString
unescape_string(io, s::AbstractString, keep = ())::Nothing
```

General unescaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`. The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which (along with backlashes) are to be kept as they are.

The following escape sequences are recognised:

  * Escaped backslash (`\\`)
  * Escaped double-quote (`\"`)
  * Standard C escape sequences (`\a`, `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\v`, `\f`, `\r`, `\e`)
  * Unicode BMP code points (`\u` with 1-4 trailing hex digits)
  * All Unicode code points (`\U` with 1-8 trailing hex digits; max value = 0010ffff)
  * Hex bytes (`\x` with 1-2 trailing hex digits)
  * Octal bytes (`\` with 1-3 trailing octal digits)

See also [`escape_string`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unescape_string("aaa\\nbbb") # C escape sequence
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> unescape_string("\\u03c0") # unicode
"π"

julia> unescape_string("\\101") # octal
"A"

julia> unescape_string("aaa \\g \\n", ['g']) # using `keep` argument
"aaa \\g \n"
```
```
union(s, itrs...)
∪(s, itrs...)
```

Construct an object containing all distinct elements from all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∪` can be typed by writing `\cup` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∪ itr`.

See also [`unique`](@ref), [`intersect`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`Iterators.flatten`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> union([1, 2], [3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> union([4 2 3 4 4], 1:3, 3.0)
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 4.0
 2.0
 3.0
 1.0

julia> (0, 0.0) ∪ (-0.0, NaN)
3-element Vector{Real}:
   0
  -0.0
 NaN

julia> union(Set([1, 2]), 2:3)
Set{Int64} with 3 elements:
  2
  3
  1
```
```
union!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the [`union`](@ref) of passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([3, 4, 5]);

julia> union!(a, 1:2:7);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 5 elements:
  5
  4
  7
  3
  1
```
```
unique(itr)
```

Return an array containing only the unique elements of collection `itr`, as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), in the order that the first of each set of equivalent elements originally appears. The element type of the input is preserved.

See also: [`unique!`](@ref), [`allunique`](@ref), [`allequal`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique([1, 2, 6, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> unique(Real[1, 1.0, 2])
2-element Vector{Real}:
 1
 2
```

```
unique(f, itr)
```

Returns an array containing one value from `itr` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `itr`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4
```

```
unique(A::AbstractArray; dims::Int)
```

Return unique regions of `A` along dimension `dims`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = map(isodd, reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2)))
2×2×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0

[:, :, 2] =
 1  1
 0  0

julia> unique(A)
2-element Vector{Bool}:
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=2)
2×1×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1
 0

[:, :, 2] =
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=3)
2×2×1 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0
```
```
unique!(f, A::AbstractVector)
```

Selects one value from `A` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `A`, then return the modified A.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method is available as of Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4

julia> unique!(n -> n%3, [5, 1, 8, 9, 3, 4, 10, 7, 2, 6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 1
 9

julia> unique!(iseven, [2, 3, 5, 7, 9])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```

```
unique!(A::AbstractVector)
```

Remove duplicate items as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), then return the modified `A`. `unique!` will return the elements of `A` in the order that they occur. If you do not care about the order of the returned data, then calling `(sort!(A); unique!(A))` will be much more efficient as long as the elements of `A` can be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!([1, 1, 1])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

julia> A = [7, 3, 2, 3, 7, 5];

julia> unique!(A)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 7
 3
 2
 5

julia> B = [7, 6, 42, 6, 7, 42];

julia> sort!(B);  # unique! is able to process sorted data much more efficiently.

julia> unique!(B)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  6
  7
 42
```
```
unlock(lock)
```

Releases ownership of the `lock`.

If this is a recursive lock which has been acquired before, decrement an internal counter and return immediately.
```
unmark(s::IO)
```

Remove a mark from stream `s`. Return `true` if the stream was marked, `false` otherwise.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers `dest` and `src` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source array to a destination, starting at offset `so` in the source and `do` in the destination (1-indexed).

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed to ensure that N is inbounds on either array. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, i::Integer=1)
```

Load a value of type `T` from the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1]`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may segfault your program or return garbage answers, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_pointer_to_objref(p::Ptr)
```

Convert a `Ptr` to an object reference. Assumes the pointer refers to a valid heap-allocated Julia object. If this is not the case, undefined behavior results, hence this function is considered "unsafe" and should be used with care.

See also [`pointer_from_objref`](@ref).
```
unsafe_read(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from the `IO` stream object into `ref` (converted to a pointer).

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_read(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsafe_store!(p::Ptr{T}, x, i::Integer=1)
```

Store a value of type `T` to the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1] = x`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_string(p::Ptr{UInt8}, [length::Integer])
```

Copy a string from the address of a C-style (NUL-terminated) string encoded as UTF-8. (The pointer can be safely freed afterwards.) If `length` is specified (the length of the data in bytes), the string does not have to be NUL-terminated.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `p` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_trunc(T, x)
```

Return the nearest integral value of type `T` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`. If the value is not representable by `T`, an arbitrary value will be returned. See also [`trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, -2.2)
-2

julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, NaN)
-9223372036854775808
```
```
unsafe_wrap(Array, pointer::Ptr{T}, dims; own = false)
```

Wrap a Julia `Array` object around the data at the address given by `pointer`, without making a copy.  The pointer element type `T` determines the array element type. `dims` is either an integer (for a 1d array) or a tuple of the array dimensions. `own` optionally specifies whether Julia should take ownership of the memory, calling `free` on the pointer when the array is no longer referenced.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `pointer` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_write(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from `ref` (converted to a pointer) into the `IO` object.

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_write(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsigned(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the unsigned type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(Int16)
UInt16
julia> unsigned(UInt64)
UInt64
```

```
unsigned(x)
```

Convert a number to an unsigned integer. If the argument is signed, it is reinterpreted as unsigned without checking for negative values.

See also: [`signed`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(-2)
0xfffffffffffffffe

julia> unsigned(2)
0x0000000000000002

julia> signed(unsigned(-2))
-2
```
```
uperm(file)
```

Get the permissions of the owner of the file as a bitfield of

| Value | Description        |
|:----- |:------------------ |
| 01    | Execute Permission |
| 02    | Write Permission   |
| 04    | Read Permission    |

For allowed arguments, see [`stat`](@ref).
```
uppercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to uppercase.

See also [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercase("Julia")
"JULIA"
```
```
uppercasefirst(s::AbstractString) -> String
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to uppercase (technically "title case" for Unicode). See also [`titlecase`](@ref) to capitalize the first character of every word in `s`.

See also [`lowercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercasefirst("python")
"Python"
```
```
valtype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
valtype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the value type of an array. This is identical to `eltype` and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(["one", "two", "three"])
String
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
valtype(type)
```

Get the value type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
String
```
```
values(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values, return an iterator over the values. This function simply returns its argument by default, since the elements of a general iterator are normally considered its "values".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2);

julia> values(d)
ValueIterator for a Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  2
  1

julia> values([2])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
```

```
values(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all values in a collection. `collect(values(a))` returns an array of values. When the values are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(values(D))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```
```
vcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 1. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(vcat, x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3 4 5]
1×5 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4  5

julia> b = [6 7 8 9 10; 11 12 13 14 15]
2×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> vcat(a,b)
3×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  1   2   3   4   5
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> c = ([1 2 3], [4 5 6])
([1 2 3], [4 5 6])

julia> vcat(c...)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vs = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
 [5, 6]

julia> reduce(vcat, vs)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
vec(a::AbstractArray) -> AbstractVector
```

Reshape the array `a` as a one-dimensional column vector. Return `a` if it is already an `AbstractVector`. The resulting array shares the same underlying data as `a`, so it will only be mutable if `a` is mutable, in which case modifying one will also modify the other.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vec(a)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 2
 5
 3
 6

julia> vec(1:3)
1:3
```

See also [`reshape`](@ref), [`dropdims`](@ref).
```
view(A, inds...)
```

Like [`getindex`](@ref), but returns a lightweight array that lazily references (or is effectively a *view* into) the parent array `A` at the given index or indices `inds` instead of eagerly extracting elements or constructing a copied subset. Calling [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) on the returned value (often a [`SubArray`](@ref)) computes the indices to access or modify the parent array on the fly.  The behavior is undefined if the shape of the parent array is changed after `view` is called because there is no bound check for the parent array; e.g., it may cause a segmentation fault.

Some immutable parent arrays (like ranges) may choose to simply recompute a new array in some circumstances instead of returning a `SubArray` if doing so is efficient and provides compatible semantics.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    In Julia 1.6 or later, `view` can be called on an `AbstractString`, returning a `SubString`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = view(A, :, 1)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A # Note A has changed even though we modified b
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4

julia> view(2:5, 2:3) # returns a range as type is immutable
3:4
```
```
wait([x])
```

Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

  * [`Channel`](@ref): Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
  * [`Condition`](@ref): Wait for [`notify`](@ref) on a condition and return the `val` parameter passed to `notify`.
  * `Process`: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The `exitcode` field of a process can be used to determine success or failure.
  * [`Task`](@ref): Wait for a `Task` to finish. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.
  * [`RawFD`](@ref): Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see the `FileWatching` package).

If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. A task can only be restarted by an explicit call to [`schedule`](@ref) or [`yieldto`](@ref).

Often `wait` is called within a `while` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before proceeding.

Special note for [`Threads.Condition`](@ref):

The caller must be holding the [`lock`](@ref) that owns a `Threads.Condition` before calling this method. The calling task will be blocked until some other task wakes it, usually by calling [`notify`](@ref) on the same `Threads.Condition` object. The lock will be atomically released when blocking (even if it was locked recursively), and will be reacquired before returning.

```
wait(r::Future)
```

Wait for a value to become available for the specified [`Future`](@ref).

```
wait(r::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Wait for a value to become available on the specified [`RemoteChannel`](@ref).
```
walkdir(dir; topdown=true, follow_symlinks=false, onerror=throw)
```

Return an iterator that walks the directory tree of a directory. The iterator returns a tuple containing `(rootpath, dirs, files)`. The directory tree can be traversed top-down or bottom-up. If `walkdir` or `stat` encounters a `IOError` it will rethrow the error by default. A custom error handling function can be provided through `onerror` keyword argument. `onerror` is called with a `IOError` as argument.

# Examples

```julia
for (root, dirs, files) in walkdir(".")
    println("Directories in $root")
    for dir in dirs
        println(joinpath(root, dir)) # path to directories
    end
    println("Files in $root")
    for file in files
        println(joinpath(root, file)) # path to files
    end
end
```

```julia-repl
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> itr = walkdir("my");

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my", ["test"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test", ["dir"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test/dir", String[], String[])
```
```
which(f, types)
```

Returns the method of `f` (a `Method` object) that would be called for arguments of the given `types`.

If `types` is an abstract type, then the method that would be called by `invoke` is returned.

See also: [`parentmodule`](@ref), and `@which` and `@edit` in [`InteractiveUtils`](@ref man-interactive-utils).

```
which(types::Type{<:Tuple})
```

Returns the method that would be called by the given type signature (as a tuple type).

```
which(module, symbol)
```

Return the module in which the binding for the variable referenced by `symbol` in `module` was created.
```
widemul(x, y)
```

Multiply `x` and `y`, giving the result as a larger type.

See also [`promote`](@ref), [`Base.add_sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widemul(Float32(3.0), 4.0) isa BigFloat
true

julia> typemax(Int8) * typemax(Int8)
1

julia> widemul(typemax(Int8), typemax(Int8))  # == 127^2
16129
```
```
widen(x)
```

If `x` is a type, return a "larger" type, defined so that arithmetic operations `+` and `-` are guaranteed not to overflow nor lose precision for any combination of values that type `x` can hold.

For fixed-size integer types less than 128 bits, `widen` will return a type with twice the number of bits.

If `x` is a value, it is converted to `widen(typeof(x))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widen(Int32)
Int64

julia> widen(1.5f0)
1.5
```
```
withenv(f, kv::Pair...)
```

Execute `f` in an environment that is temporarily modified (not replaced as in `setenv`) by zero or more `"var"=>val` arguments `kv`. `withenv` is generally used via the `withenv(kv...) do ... end` syntax. A value of `nothing` can be used to temporarily unset an environment variable (if it is set). When `withenv` returns, the original environment has been restored.
```
write(io::IO, x)
write(filename::AbstractString, x)
```

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given I/O stream or file. Return the number of bytes written into the stream. See also [`print`](@ref) to write a text representation (with an encoding that may depend upon `io`).

The endianness of the written value depends on the endianness of the host system. Convert to/from a fixed endianness when writing/reading (e.g. using  [`htol`](@ref) and [`ltoh`](@ref)) to get results that are consistent across platforms.

You can write multiple values with the same `write` call. i.e. the following are equivalent:

```
write(io, x, y...)
write(io, x) + write(io, y...)
```

# Examples

Consistent serialization:

```jldoctest
julia> fname = tempname(); # random temporary filename

julia> open(fname,"w") do f
           # Make sure we write 64bit integer in little-endian byte order
           write(f,htol(Int64(42)))
       end
8

julia> open(fname,"r") do f
           # Convert back to host byte order and host integer type
           Int(ltoh(read(f,Int64)))
       end
42
```

Merging write calls:

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."

julia> write(io, "Sometimes those members") + write(io, " write documentation.")
44

julia> String(take!(io))
"Sometimes those members write documentation."
```

User-defined plain-data types without `write` methods can be written when wrapped in a `Ref`:

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct; x::Float64; end

julia> io = IOBuffer()
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=0, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> write(io, Ref(MyStruct(42.0)))
8

julia> seekstart(io); read!(io, Ref(MyStruct(NaN)))
Base.RefValue{MyStruct}(MyStruct(42.0))
```
```
xor(x, y)
⊻(x, y)
```

Bitwise exclusive or of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊻ b` is a synonym for `xor(a,b)`, and `⊻` can be typed by tab-completing `\xor` or `\veebar` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> xor(true, false)
true

julia> xor(true, true)
false

julia> xor(true, missing)
missing

julia> false ⊻ false
false

julia> [true; true; false] .⊻ [true; false; false]
3-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
```
```
yield()
```

Switch to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run. A task that calls this function is still runnable, and will be restarted immediately if there are no other runnable tasks.

```
yield(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

A fast, unfair-scheduling version of `schedule(t, arg); yield()` which immediately yields to `t` before calling the scheduler.
```
yieldto(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with no arguments. On subsequent switches, `arg` is returned from the task's last call to `yieldto`. This is a low-level call that only switches tasks, not considering states or scheduling in any way. Its use is discouraged.
```
zero(x)
zero(::Type)
```

Get the additive identity element for the type of `x` (`x` can also specify the type itself).

See also [`iszero`](@ref), [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zero(1)
0

julia> zero(big"2.0")
0.0

julia> zero(rand(2,2))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0
```
```
zeros([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
zeros([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all zeros with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`ones`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zeros(1)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0

julia> zeros(Int8, 2, 3)
2×3 Matrix{Int8}:
 0  0  0
 0  0  0
```
```
zip(iters...)
```

Run multiple iterators at the same time, until any of them is exhausted. The value type of the `zip` iterator is a tuple of values of its subiterators.

!!! note
    `zip` orders the calls to its subiterators in such a way that stateful iterators will not advance when another iterator finishes in the current iteration.


See also: [`enumerate`](@ref), [`splat`](@ref Base.splat).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:5
1:5

julia> b = ["e","d","b","c","a"]
5-element Vector{String}:
 "e"
 "d"
 "b"
 "c"
 "a"

julia> c = zip(a,b)
zip(1:5, ["e", "d", "b", "c", "a"])

julia> length(c)
5

julia> first(c)
(1, "e")
```
```
x | y
```

Bitwise or. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `false`.

See also: [`&`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`||`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 | 10
14

julia> 4 | 1
5

julia> true | missing
true

julia> false | missing
missing
```
```
|>(x, f)
```

Applies a function to the preceding argument. This allows for easy function chaining.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1:5;] |> (x->x.^2) |> sum |> inv
0.01818181818181818
```
```
~(x)
```

Bitwise not.

julia> ~4
-5

julia> ~10
-11

julia> ~true

```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

See also: [`cld`](@ref), [`fld`](@ref), [`rem`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 9 ÷ 4

julia> 5.0 ÷ 2
2.0

julia> div.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

# Examples:

```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

!!! note
    The function in which `@boundscheck` is written must be inlined into its caller in order for `@inbounds` to have effect.

!!! warning
    The `@boundscheck` annotation allows you, as a library writer, to opt-in to allowing *other code* to remove your bounds checks with [`@inbounds`](@ref). As noted there, the caller must verify—using information they can access—that their accesses are valid before using `@inbounds`. For indexing into your [`AbstractArray`](@ref) subclasses, for example, this involves checking the indices against its [`axes`](@ref). Therefore, `@boundscheck` annotations should only be added to a [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) implementation after you are certain its behavior is correct.

```
@ccall library.function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall $function_pointer(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
```

Call a function in a C-exported shared library, specified by `library.function_name`, where `library` is a string constant or literal. The library may be omitted, in which case the `function_name` is resolved in the current process. Alternatively, `@ccall` may also be used to call a function pointer `$function_pointer`, such as one returned by `dlsym`.

Each `argvalue` to `@ccall` is converted to the corresponding `argtype`, by automatic insertion of calls to `unsafe_convert(argtype, cconvert(argtype, argvalue))`. (See also the documentation for [`unsafe_convert`](@ref Base.unsafe_convert) and [`cconvert`](@ref Base.cconvert) for further details.) In most cases, this simply results in a call to `convert(argtype, argvalue)`.

# Examples

```
@ccall strlen(s::Cstring)::Csize_t
```

This calls the C standard library function:

```
size_t strlen(char *)
```

with a Julia variable named `s`. See also `ccall`.

Varargs are supported with the following convention:

```
@ccall printf("%s = %d"::Cstring ; "foo"::Cstring, foo::Cint)::Cint
```

The semicolon is used to separate required arguments (of which there must be at least one) from variadic arguments.

Example using an external library:

```
# C signature of g_uri_escape_string:
# char *g_uri_escape_string(const char *unescaped, const char *reserved_chars_allowed, gboolean allow_utf8);

const glib = "libglib-2.0"
@ccall glib.g_uri_escape_string(my_uri::Cstring, ":/"::Cstring, true::Cint)::Cstring
```

The string literal could also be used directly before the function name, if desired `"libglib-2.0".g_uri_escape_string(...`
```
@cfunction(callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> Ptr{Cvoid}
@cfunction($callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> CFunction
```

Generate a C-callable function pointer from the Julia function `callable` for the given type signature. To pass the return value to a `ccall`, use the argument type `Ptr{Cvoid}` in the signature.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression (although it can include a splat expression). And that these arguments will be evaluated in global scope during compile-time (not deferred until runtime). Adding a '$' in front of the function argument changes this to instead create a runtime closure over the local variable `callable` (this is not supported on all architectures).

See [manual section on ccall and cfunction usage](@ref Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
           return x + y
       end

julia> @cfunction(foo, Int, (Int, Int))
Ptr{Cvoid} @0x000000001b82fcd0
```
```
@cmd str
```

Similar to `cmd`, generate a `Cmd` from the `str` string which represents the shell command(s) to be executed. The [`Cmd`](@ref) object can be run as a process and can outlive the spawning julia process (see `Cmd` for more).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cm = @cmd " echo 1 "
`echo 1`

julia> run(cm)
1
Process(`echo 1`, ProcessExited(0))
```
```
@coalesce(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); missing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @coalesce a f(2) f(3) error("`a` is still missing")
1

julia> b = missing;

julia> b = @coalesce b f(2) f(3) error("`b` is still missing")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: `b` is still missing
[...]

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@deprecate old new [export_old=true]
```

Deprecate method `old` and specify the replacement call `new`. Prevent `@deprecate` from exporting `old` by setting `export_old` to `false`. `@deprecate` defines a new method with the same signature as `old`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    As of Julia 1.5, functions defined by `@deprecate` do not print warning when `julia` is run without the `--depwarn=yes` flag set, as the default value of `--depwarn` option is `no`.  The warnings are printed from tests run by `Pkg.test()`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x)
old (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x) false
old (generic function with 1 method)
```
# Documentation

Functions, methods and types can be documented by placing a string before the definition:

```
"""
# The Foo Function
`foo(x)`: Foo the living hell out of `x`.
"""
foo(x) = ...
```

The `@doc` macro can be used directly to both set and retrieve documentation / metadata. The macro has special parsing so that the documented object may occur on the next line:

```
@doc "blah"
function foo() ...
```

By default, documentation is written as Markdown, but any object can be used as the first argument.

## Documenting objects after they are defined

You can document an object after its definition by

```
@doc "foo" function_to_doc
@doc "bar" TypeToDoc
```

For macros, the syntax is `@doc "macro doc" :(@Module.macro)` or `@doc "macro doc" :(string_macro"")` for string macros. Without the quote `:()` the expansion of the macro will be documented.

## Retrieving Documentation

You can retrieve docs for functions, macros and other objects as follows:

```
@doc foo
@doc @time
@doc md""
```

## Functions & Methods

Placing documentation before a method definition (e.g. `function foo() ...` or `foo() = ...`) will cause that specific method to be documented, as opposed to the whole function. Method docs are concatenated together in the order they were defined to provide docs for the function.
```
@elapsed
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the number of seconds it took to execute as a floating-point number.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@elapsed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@elapsed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @elapsed sleep(0.3)
0.301391426
```
```
@enum EnumName[::BaseType] value1[=x] value2[=y]
```

Create an `Enum{BaseType}` subtype with name `EnumName` and enum member values of `value1` and `value2` with optional assigned values of `x` and `y`, respectively. `EnumName` can be used just like other types and enum member values as regular values, such as

# Examples

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> @enum Fruit apple=1 orange=2 kiwi=3

julia> f(x::Fruit) = "I'm a Fruit with value: $(Int(x))"
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(apple)
"I'm a Fruit with value: 1"

julia> Fruit(1)
apple::Fruit = 1
```

Values can also be specified inside a `begin` block, e.g.

```julia
@enum EnumName begin
    value1
    value2
end
```

`BaseType`, which defaults to [`Int32`](@ref), must be a primitive subtype of `Integer`. Member values can be converted between the enum type and `BaseType`. `read` and `write` perform these conversions automatically. In case the enum is created with a non-default `BaseType`, `Integer(value1)` will return the integer `value1` with the type `BaseType`.

To list all the instances of an enum use `instances`, e.g.

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> instances(Fruit)
(apple, orange, kiwi)
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]

```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@eval [mod,] ex
```

Evaluate an expression with values interpolated into it using `eval`. If two arguments are provided, the first is the module to evaluate in.
```
@evalpoly(z, c...)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k z^{k-1} c[k]$ for the coefficients `c[1]`, `c[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `z`.  This macro expands to efficient inline code that uses either Horner's method or, for complex `z`, a more efficient Goertzel-like algorithm.

See also [`evalpoly`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @evalpoly(3, 1, 0, 1)
10

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 0, 1)
5

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 1, 1)
7
```
```
@fastmath expr
```

Execute a transformed version of the expression, which calls functions that may violate strict IEEE semantics. This allows the fastest possible operation, but results are undefined – be careful when doing this, as it may change numerical results.

This sets the [LLVM Fast-Math flags](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags), and corresponds to the `-ffast-math` option in clang. See [the notes on performance annotations](@ref man-performance-annotations) for more details.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @fastmath 1+2
3

julia> @fastmath(sin(3))
0.1411200080598672
```
```
@generated f
```

`@generated` is used to annotate a function which will be generated. In the body of the generated function, only types of arguments can be read (not the values). The function returns a quoted expression evaluated when the function is called. The `@generated` macro should not be used on functions mutating the global scope or depending on mutable elements.

See [Metaprogramming](@ref) for further details.

## Example:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else
               return :(x)
           end
       end
bar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar(4)
16

julia> bar("baz")
"baz"
```
```
@gensym
```

Generates a gensym symbol for a variable. For example, `@gensym x y` is transformed into `x = gensym("x"); y = gensym("y")`.
```
@goto name
```

`@goto name` unconditionally jumps to the statement at the location [`@label name`](@ref).

`@label` and `@goto` cannot create jumps to different top-level statements. Attempts cause an error. To still use `@goto`, enclose the `@label` and `@goto` in a block.
```
@html_str -> Docs.HTML
```

Create an `HTML` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> html"Julia"
HTML{String}("Julia")
```
```
@inbounds(blk)
```

Eliminates array bounds checking within expressions.

In the example below the in-range check for referencing element `i` of array `A` is skipped to improve performance.

```julia
function sum(A::AbstractArray)
    r = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in eachindex(A)
        @inbounds r += A[i]
    end
    return r
end
```

!!! warning
    Using `@inbounds` may return incorrect results/crashes/corruption for out-of-bounds indices. The user is responsible for checking it manually. Only use `@inbounds` when it is certain from the information locally available that all accesses are in bounds.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@inline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that this function is worth inlining.

Small functions typically do not need the `@inline` annotation, as the compiler does it automatically. By using `@inline` on bigger functions, an extra nudge can be given to the compiler to inline it.

`@inline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@inline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@inline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @inline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@inline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that calls within `block` are worth inlining.

```julia
# The compiler will try to inline `f`
@inline f(...)

# The compiler will try to inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@inline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @noinline function explicit_noinline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @inline explicit_noinline(args...) # will be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @noinline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @inline f(a0)  # the compiler will try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)          # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! warning
    Although a callsite annotation will try to force inlining in regardless of the cost model, there are still chances it can't succeed in it. Especially, recursive calls can not be inlined even if they are annotated as `@inline`d.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
@int128_str str

@isdefined s -> Bool
```

Tests whether variable `s` is defined in the current scope.

See also [`isdefined`](@ref) for field properties and [`isassigned`](@ref) for array indexes or [`haskey`](@ref) for other mappings.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @isdefined newvar

julia> function f()
           println(@isdefined x)

```
@label name
```

Labels a statement with the symbolic label `name`. The label marks the end-point of an unconditional jump with [`@goto name`](@ref).
```
lazy"str"
```

Create a [`LazyString`](@ref) using regular string interpolation syntax. Note that interpolations are *evaluated* at LazyString construction time, but *printing* is delayed until the first access to the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    `lazy"str"` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

```
@lock l expr
```

Macro version of `lock(f, l::AbstractLock)` but with `expr` instead of `f` function. Expands to:

```julia
lock(l)
try
    expr
finally
    unlock(l)
end
```

This is similar to using [`lock`](@ref) with a `do` block, but avoids creating a closure and thus can improve the performance.
```
@macroexpand
```

Return equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded).

There are differences between `@macroexpand` and [`macroexpand`](@ref).

  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) takes a keyword argument `recursive`, `@macroexpand` is always recursive. For a non recursive macro version, see [`@macroexpand1`](@ref).
  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) has an explicit `module` argument, `@macroexpand` always expands with respect to the module in which it is called.

This is best seen in the following example:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m()
               1
           end
           function f()
               (@macroexpand(@m),
                macroexpand(M, :(@m)),
                macroexpand(Main, :(@m))
               )
           end
       end
M

julia> macro m()
           2
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> M.f()
(1, 1, 2)
```

With `@macroexpand` the expression expands where `@macroexpand` appears in the code (module `M` in the example). With `macroexpand` the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.
```
@macroexpand1
```

Non recursive version of [`@macroexpand`](@ref).
```
@noinline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline a function.

Small functions are typically inlined automatically. By using `@noinline` on small functions, auto-inlining can be prevented.

`@noinline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@noinline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@noinline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @noinline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@noinline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline the calls within `block`.

```julia
# The compiler will try to not inline `f`
@noinline f(...)

# The compiler will try to not inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@noinline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @inline function explicit_inline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @noinline explicit_inline(args...) # will not be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @inline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @noinline f(a0)  # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)            # the compiler will try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

!!! note
    If the function is trivial (for example returning a constant) it might get inlined anyway.

```
@nospecialize
```

Applied to a function argument name, hints to the compiler that the method should not be specialized for different types of that argument, but instead to use precisely the declared type for each argument. This is only a hint for avoiding excess code generation. Can be applied to an argument within a formal argument list, or in the function body. When applied to an argument, the macro must wrap the entire argument expression. When used in a function body, the macro must occur in statement position and before any code.

When used without arguments, it applies to all arguments of the parent scope. In local scope, this means all arguments of the containing function. In global (top-level) scope, this means all methods subsequently defined in the current module.

Specialization can reset back to the default by using [`@specialize`](@ref).

```julia
function example_function(@nospecialize x)
    ...
end

function example_function(x, @nospecialize(y = 1))
    ...
end

function example_function(x, y, z)
    @nospecialize x y
    ...
end

@nospecialize
f(y) = [x for x in y]
@specialize
```
```
@polly
```

Tells the compiler to apply the polyhedral optimizer Polly to a function.
```
@r_str -> Regex
```

Construct a regex, such as `r"^[a-z]*$"`, without interpolation and unescaping (except for quotation mark `"` which still has to be escaped). The regex also accepts one or more flags, listed after the ending quote, to change its behaviour:

  * `i` enables case-insensitive matching
  * `m` treats the `^` and `$` tokens as matching the start and end of individual lines, as opposed to the whole string.
  * `s` allows the `.` modifier to match newlines.
  * `x` enables "comment mode": whitespace is enabled except when escaped with `\`, and `#` is treated as starting a comment.
  * `a` disables `UCP` mode (enables ASCII mode). By default `\B`, `\b`, `\D`, `\d`, `\S`, `\s`, `\W`, `\w`, etc. match based on Unicode character properties. With this option, these sequences only match ASCII characters.

See [`Regex`](@ref) if interpolation is needed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"a+.*b+.*?d$"ism, "Goodbye,\nOh, angry,\nBad world\n")
RegexMatch("angry,\nBad world")
```

This regex has the first three flags enabled.
```
@raw_str -> String
```

Create a raw string without interpolation and unescaping. The exception is that quotation marks still must be escaped. Backslashes escape both quotation marks and other backslashes, but only when a sequence of backslashes precedes a quote character. Thus, 2n backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes and the end of the literal while 2n+1 backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes followed by a quote character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println(raw"\ $x")
\ $x

julia> println(raw"\"")
"

julia> println(raw"\\\"")
\"

julia> println(raw"\\x \\\"")
\\x \"
```
```
@s_str -> SubstitutionString
```

Construct a substitution string, used for regular expression substitutions.  Within the string, sequences of the form `\N` refer to the Nth capture group in the regex, and `\g<groupname>` refers to a named capture group with name `groupname`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> msg = "#Hello# from Julia";

julia> replace(msg, r"#(.+)# from (?<from>\w+)" => s"FROM: \g<from>; MESSAGE: \1")
"FROM: Julia; MESSAGE: Hello"
```
```
@show exs...
```

Prints one or more expressions, and their results, to `stdout`, and returns the last result.

See also: [`show`](@ref), [`@info`](@ref man-logging), [`println`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = @show 1+2
1 + 2 = 3
3

julia> @show x^2 x/2;
x ^ 2 = 9
x / 2 = 1.5
```
```
@showtime expr
```

Like `@time` but also prints the expression being evaluated for reference.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This macro was added in Julia 1.8.


See also [`@time`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @showtime sleep(1)
sleep(1): 1.002164 seconds (4 allocations: 128 bytes)
```
```
@simd
```

Annotate a `for` loop to allow the compiler to take extra liberties to allow loop re-ordering

!!! warning
    This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia. Incorrect use of the `@simd` macro may cause unexpected results.


The object iterated over in a `@simd for` loop should be a one-dimensional range. By using `@simd`, you are asserting several properties of the loop:

  * It is safe to execute iterations in arbitrary or overlapping order, with special consideration for reduction variables.
  * Floating-point operations on reduction variables can be reordered, possibly causing different results than without `@simd`.

In many cases, Julia is able to automatically vectorize inner for loops without the use of `@simd`. Using `@simd` gives the compiler a little extra leeway to make it possible in more situations. In either case, your inner loop should have the following properties to allow vectorization:

  * The loop must be an innermost loop
  * The loop body must be straight-line code. Therefore, [`@inbounds`](@ref) is   currently needed for all array accesses. The compiler can sometimes turn   short `&&`, `||`, and `?:` expressions into straight-line code if it is safe   to evaluate all operands unconditionally. Consider using the [`ifelse`](@ref)   function instead of `?:` in the loop if it is safe to do so.
  * Accesses must have a stride pattern and cannot be "gathers" (random-index   reads) or "scatters" (random-index writes).
  * The stride should be unit stride.

!!! note
    The `@simd` does not assert by default that the loop is completely free of loop-carried memory dependencies, which is an assumption that can easily be violated in generic code. If you are writing non-generic code, you can use `@simd ivdep for ... end` to also assert that:


  * There exists no loop-carried memory dependencies
  * No iteration ever waits on a previous iteration to make forward progress.
```
@something(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); nothing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @something a f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `a`")
1

julia> b = nothing;

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `b`")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: Unable to find default for `b`
[...]

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) Some(nothing)
f(2)
f(3)

julia> b === nothing
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@specialize
```

Reset the specialization hint for an argument back to the default. For details, see [`@nospecialize`](@ref).
```
@static
```

Partially evaluate an expression at parse time.

For example, `@static Sys.iswindows() ? foo : bar` will evaluate `Sys.iswindows()` and insert either `foo` or `bar` into the expression. This is useful in cases where a construct would be invalid on other platforms, such as a `ccall` to a non-existent function. `@static if Sys.isapple() foo end` and `@static foo <&&,||> bar` are also valid syntax.
```
@sync
```

Wait until all lexically-enclosed uses of `@async`, `@spawn`, `@spawnat` and `@distributed` are complete. All exceptions thrown by enclosed async operations are collected and thrown as a `CompositeException`.
```
@task
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) without executing it, and return the [`Task`](@ref). This only creates a task, and does not run it.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a1() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = @task a1();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
@text_str -> Docs.Text
```

Create a `Text` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> text"Julia"
Julia
```
```
@threadcall((cfunc, clib), rettype, (argtypes...), argvals...)
```

The `@threadcall` macro is called in the same way as [`ccall`](@ref) but does the work in a different thread. This is useful when you want to call a blocking C function without causing the main `julia` thread to become blocked. Concurrency is limited by size of the libuv thread pool, which defaults to 4 threads but can be increased by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable and restarting the `julia` process.

Note that the called function should never call back into Julia.
```
@time expr
@time "description" expr
```

A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations, and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression. Any time spent garbage collecting (gc), compiling new code, or recompiling invalidated code is shown as a percentage.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@time` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@time @eval ...`.

See also [`@showtime`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

!!! note
    For more serious benchmarking, consider the `@btime` macro from the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The option to add a description was introduced in Julia 1.8.

    Recompilation time being shown separately from compilation time was introduced in Julia 1.8


```julia-repl
julia> x = rand(10,10);

julia> @time x * x;

2: 1.001263 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
3: 1.003676 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
```
```
@timed
```

A macro to execute an expression, and return the value of the expression, elapsed time, total bytes allocated, garbage collection time, and an object with various memory allocation counters.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@timed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@timed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> stats = @timed rand(10^6);

julia> stats.time

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The return type of this macro was changed from `Tuple` to `NamedTuple` in Julia 1.5.

```
@timev expr
@timev "description" expr
```

This is a verbose version of the `@time` macro. It first prints the same information as `@time`, then any non-zero memory allocation counters, and then returns the value of the expression.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

```
@uint128_str str
@uint128_str(str)
```

`@uint128_str` parses a string into a UInt128. Throws an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid integer.
```
@v_str
```

String macro used to parse a string to a [`VersionNumber`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v"1.2.3"
v"1.2.3"

julia> v"2.0.1-rc1"
v"2.0.1-rc1"
```
```
@view A[inds...]
```

Transform the indexing expression `A[inds...]` into the equivalent [`view`](@ref) call.

This can only be applied directly to a single indexing expression and is particularly helpful for expressions that include the special `begin` or `end` indexing syntaxes like `A[begin, 2:end-1]` (as those are not supported by the normal [`view`](@ref) function).

Note that `@view` cannot be used as the target of a regular assignment (e.g., `@view(A[1, 2:end]) = ...`), nor would the un-decorated [indexed assignment](@ref man-indexed-assignment) (`A[1, 2:end] = ...`) or broadcasted indexed assignment (`A[1, 2:end] .= ...`) make a copy.  It can be useful, however, for *updating* broadcasted assignments like `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .+= 1` because this is a simple syntax for `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .= @view(A[1, 2:end]) + 1`, and the indexing expression on the right-hand side would otherwise make a copy without the `@view`.

See also [`@views`](@ref) to switch an entire block of code to use views for non-scalar indexing.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = @view A[:, 1]
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4
```
```
@views expression
```

Convert every array-slicing operation in the given expression (which may be a `begin`/`end` block, loop, function, etc.) to return a view. Scalar indices, non-array types, and explicit [`getindex`](@ref) calls (as opposed to `array[...]`) are unaffected.

!!! note
    The `@views` macro only affects `array[...]` expressions that appear explicitly in the given `expression`, not array slicing that occurs in functions called by that code.


!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(3, 3);

julia> @views for row in 1:3
           b = A[row, :]
           b[:] .= row
       end

julia> A
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 3.0  3.0  3.0
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
PipeBuffer(data::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[]; maxsize::Integer = typemax(Int))
```

An [`IOBuffer`](@ref) that allows reading and performs writes by appending. Seeking and truncating are not supported. See [`IOBuffer`](@ref) for the available constructors. If `data` is given, creates a `PipeBuffer` to operate on a data vector, optionally specifying a size beyond which the underlying `Array` may not be grown.
```
\(x, y)
```

Left division operator: multiplication of `y` by the inverse of `x` on the left. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 \ 6
2.0

julia> inv(3) * 6
2.0

julia> A = [4 3; 2 1]; x = [5, 6];

julia> A \ x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0

julia> inv(A) * x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0
```

```
\(A, B)
```

Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices `A` and `B`, the result `X` is such that `A*X == B` when `A` is square. The solver that is used depends upon the structure of `A`.  If `A` is upper or lower triangular (or diagonal), no factorization of `A` is required and the system is solved with either forward or backward substitution. For non-triangular square matrices, an LU factorization is used.

For rectangular `A` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of `A` and a rank estimate of `A` based on the R factor.

When `A` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the `LDLt` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

See also: [`factorize`](@ref), [`pinv`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 0; 1 -2]; B = [32; -4];

julia> X = A \ B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 32.0
 18.0

julia> A * X == B
true
```

```
(\)(F::QRSparse, B::StridedVecOrMat)
```

Solve the least squares problem $\min\|Ax - b\|^2$ or the linear system of equations $Ax=b$ when `F` is the sparse QR factorization of $A$. A basic solution is returned when the problem is underdetermined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse([1,2,4], [1,1,1], [1.0,1.0,1.0], 4, 2)
4×2 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1.0   ⋅
 1.0   ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅
 1.0   ⋅

julia> qr(A)\fill(1.0, 4)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0
```
```
^(x, y)
```

Exponentiation operator. If `x` is a matrix, computes matrix exponentiation.

If `y` is an `Int` literal (e.g. `2` in `x^2` or `-3` in `x^-3`), the Julia code `x^y` is transformed by the compiler to `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y))`, to enable compile-time specialization on the value of the exponent. (As a default fallback we have `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y)) = ^(x,y)`, where usually `^ == Base.^` unless `^` has been defined in the calling namespace.) If `y` is a negative integer literal, then `Base.literal_pow` transforms the operation to `inv(x)^-y` by default, where `-y` is positive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3^5
243

julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> A^3
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 37   54
 81  118
```

```
^(s::Union{AbstractString,AbstractChar}, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a string or character `n` times. This can also be written as `repeat(s, n)`.

See also [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Test "^3
"Test Test Test "
```

```
^(s::Regex, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a regex `n` times.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"

```

Matrix exponential, equivalent to $\exp(\log(b)A)$.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"

```
```
__precompile__(isprecompilable::Bool)
```

Specify whether the file calling this function is precompilable, defaulting to `true`. If a module or file is *not* safely precompilable, it should call `__precompile__(false)` in order to throw an error if Julia attempts to precompile it.
```
abs(x)
```

The absolute value of `x`.

When `abs` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when `abs` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when `x == typemin(typeof(x))`, `abs(x) == x < 0`, not `-x` as might be expected.

See also: [`abs2`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref).

abs2(x)
```

Squared absolute value of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> abs2(-3)
9
```
```
abspath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Convert a path to an absolute path by adding the current directory if necessary. Also normalizes the path as in [`normpath`](@ref).

```
abspath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to an absolute path by joining them together and adding the current directory if necessary. Equivalent to `abspath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
accumulate(op, A; dims::Integer, [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` along the dimension `dims` of `A` (providing `dims` is optional for vectors). An initial value `init` may optionally be provided by a keyword argument. See also [`accumulate!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

For common operations there are specialized variants of `accumulate`, see [`cumsum`](@ref), [`cumprod`](@ref). For a lazy version, see [`Iterators.accumulate`](@ref).

```
acos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse cosine. Otherwise, the inverse cosine is determined by using [`log`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_1].

```
asyncmap(f, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Uses multiple concurrent tasks to map `f` over a collection (or multiple equal length collections). For multiple collection arguments, `f` is applied elementwise.

`ntasks` specifies the number of tasks to run concurrently. Depending on the length of the collections, if `ntasks` is unspecified, up to 100 tasks will be used for concurrent mapping.

`ntasks` can also be specified as a zero-arg function. In this case, the number of tasks to run in parallel is checked before processing every element and a new task started if the value of `ntasks_func` is greater than the current number of tasks.

If `batch_size` is specified, the collection is processed in batch mode. `f` must then be a function that must accept a `Vector` of argument tuples and must return a vector of results. The input vector will have a length of `batch_size` or less.

The following examples highlight execution in different tasks by returning the `objectid` of the tasks in which the mapping function is executed.

First, with `ntasks` undefined, each element is processed in a different task.

```
julia> tskoid() = objectid(current_task());

julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x6e15e66c75c75853
 0x440f8819a1baa682
 0x9fb3eeadd0c83985
 0xebd3e35fe90d4050
 0x29efc93edce2b961

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)))
5
```

With `ntasks=2` all elements are processed in 2 tasks.

```
julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)))
2
```

With `batch_size` defined, the mapping function needs to be changed to accept an array of argument tuples and return an array of results. `map` is used in the modified mapping function to achieve this.

```
julia> batch_func(input) = map(x->string("args_tuple: ", x, ", element_val: ", x[1], ", task: ", tskoid()), input)
batch_func (generic function with 1 method)

julia> asyncmap(batch_func, 1:5; ntasks=2, batch_size=2)
5-element Array{String,1}:
 "args_tuple: (1,), element_val: 1, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (2,), element_val: 2, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (3,), element_val: 3, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (4,), element_val: 4, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (5,), element_val: 5, task: 9118321258196414413"
```

!!! note
    Currently, all tasks in Julia are executed in a single OS thread co-operatively. Consequently, `asyncmap` is beneficial only when the mapping function involves any I/O - disk, network, remote worker invocation, etc.

```
asyncmap!(f, results, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Like [`asyncmap`](@ref), but stores output in `results` rather than returning a collection.
```
atan(y)
atan(y, x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively.

For one argument, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (1, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

For two arguments, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (*x*, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. This corresponds to a standard [`atan2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function. Note that by convention `atan(0.0,x)` is defined as $\pi$ and `atan(-0.0,x)` is defined as $-\pi$ when `x < 0`.

```
atan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse tangent. Otherwise, the inverse tangent is determined by using [`log`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_3].

julia> atan(tan([0.5 0.1; -0.2 0.3]))
2×2 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
  0.5+1.38778e-17im  0.1-2.77556e-17im
 -0.2+6.93889e-17im  0.3-4.16334e-17im
```
```
atand(y)
atand(y,x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively, where the output is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The one-argument method supports square matrix arguments as of Julia 1.7.

```
atanh(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
atanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_6].

[^AH16_6]: Mary Aprahamian and Nicholas J. Higham, "Matrix Inverse Trigonometric and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions: Theory and Algorithms", MIMS EPrint: 2016.4. [https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577)
```
atexit(f)
```

Register a zero-argument function `f()` to be called at process exit. `atexit()` hooks are called in last in first out (LIFO) order and run before object finalizers.

Exit hooks are allowed to call `exit(n)`, in which case Julia will exit with exit code `n` (instead of the original exit code). If more than one exit hook calls `exit(n)`, then Julia will exit with the exit code corresponding to the last called exit hook that calls `exit(n)`. (Because exit hooks are called in LIFO order, "last called" is equivalent to "first registered".)
```
atreplinit(f)
```

Register a one-argument function to be called before the REPL interface is initialized in interactive sessions; this is useful to customize the interface. The argument of `f` is the REPL object. This function should be called from within the `.julia/config/startup.jl` initialization file.
```
axes(A, d)
```

Return the valid range of indices for array `A` along dimension `d`.

See also [`size`](@ref), and the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A, 2)
Base.OneTo(6)
```

# Usage note

Each of the indices has to be an `AbstractUnitRange{<:Integer}`, but at the same time can be a type that uses custom indices. So, for example, if you need a subset, use generalized indexing constructs like `begin`/`end` or [`firstindex`](@ref)/[`lastindex`](@ref):

```julia
ix = axes(v, 1)
ix[2:end]          # will work for eg Vector, but may fail in general
ix[(begin+1):end]  # works for generalized indexes
```

```
axes(A)
```

Return the tuple of valid indices for array `A`.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A)
(Base.OneTo(5), Base.OneTo(6), Base.OneTo(7))
```
```
backtrace()
```

Get a backtrace object for the current program point.
```
basename(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the file name part of a path.

!!! note
    This function differs slightly from the Unix `basename` program, where trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `$ basename /foo/bar/` returns `bar`, whereas `basename` in Julia returns an empty string `""`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> basename("/home/myuser/example.jl")
"example.jl"

julia> basename("/home/myuser/")
""
```

See also [`dirname`](@ref).
```
big(T::Type)
```

Compute the type that represents the numeric type `T` with arbitrary precision. Equivalent to `typeof(big(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big(Rational)
Rational{BigInt}

julia> big(Float64)
BigFloat

julia> big(Complex{Int})
Complex{BigInt}
```

```
big(x)
```

Convert a number to a maximum precision representation (typically [`BigInt`](@ref) or `BigFloat`). See [`BigFloat`](@ref BigFloat(::Any, rounding::RoundingMode)) for information about some pitfalls with floating-point numbers.
```
bind(chnl::Channel, task::Task)
```

Associate the lifetime of `chnl` with a task. `Channel` `chnl` is automatically closed when the task terminates. Any uncaught exception in the task is propagated to all waiters on `chnl`.

The `chnl` object can be explicitly closed independent of task termination. Terminating tasks have no effect on already closed `Channel` objects.

When a channel is bound to multiple tasks, the first task to terminate will close the channel. When multiple channels are bound to the same task, termination of the task will close all of the bound channels.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:4);

julia> bind(c,task);

julia> for i in c
           @show i
       end;
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4

julia> isopen(c)
false
```

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async (put!(c, 1); error("foo"));

julia> bind(c, task);

julia> take!(c)
1

julia> put!(c, 1);
ERROR: TaskFailedException
Stacktrace:
[...]
    nested task error: foo
[...]
```

```
bind(socket::Union{TCPServer, UDPSocket, TCPSocket}, host::IPAddr, port::Integer; ipv6only=false, reuseaddr=false, kws...)
```

Bind `socket` to the given `host:port`. Note that `0.0.0.0` will listen on all devices.

  * The `ipv6only` parameter disables dual stack mode. If `ipv6only=true`, only an IPv6 stack is created.
  * If `reuseaddr=true`, multiple threads or processes can bind to the same address without error if they all set `reuseaddr=true`, but only the last to bind will receive any traffic.
```
binomial(n::Integer, k::Integer)
```

The *binomial coefficient* $\binom{n}{k}$, being the coefficient of the $k$th term in the polynomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$.

If $n$ is non-negative, then it is the number of ways to choose `k` out of `n` items:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}
$$

where $n!$ is the [`factorial`](@ref) function.

If $n$ is negative, then it is defined in terms of the identity

$$
\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{k-n-1}{k}
$$

See also [`factorial`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> binomial(5, 3)
10

julia> factorial(5) ÷ (factorial(5-3) * factorial(3))
10

julia> binomial(-5, 3)
-35
```

```
bitreverse(x)
```

Reverse the order of bits in integer `x`. `x` must have a fixed bit width, e.g. be an `Int16` or `Int32`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitreverse(0x8080808080808080)
0x0101010101010101

julia> reverse(bitstring(0xa06e)) == bitstring(bitreverse(0xa06e))
true
```
```
bitrotate(x::Base.BitInteger, k::Integer)
```

`bitrotate(x, k)` implements bitwise rotation. It returns the value of `x` with its bits rotated left `k` times. A negative value of `k` will rotate to the right instead.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


See also: [`<<`](@ref), [`circshift`](@ref), [`BitArray`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> bitrotate(UInt8(114), 2)

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 2))
"11001001"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, -2))
"10011100"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 8))
"01110010"
```
```
bitstring(n)
```

A string giving the literal bit representation of a primitive type.

See also [`count_ones`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref), [`digits`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitstring(Int32(4))
"00000000000000000000000000000100"

julia> bitstring(2.2)
"0100000000000001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011010"
```
```
broadcast(f, As...)
```

Broadcast the function `f` over the arrays, tuples, collections, [`Ref`](@ref)s and/or scalars `As`.

Broadcasting applies the function `f` over the elements of the container arguments and the scalars themselves in `As`. Singleton and missing dimensions are expanded to match the extents of the other arguments by virtually repeating the value. By default, only a limited number of types are considered scalars, including `Number`s, `String`s, `Symbol`s, `Type`s, `Function`s and some common singletons like [`missing`](@ref) and [`nothing`](@ref). All other arguments are iterated over or indexed into elementwise.

The resulting container type is established by the following rules:

  * If all the arguments are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns an unwrapped scalar.
  * If at least one argument is a tuple and all others are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns a tuple.
  * All other combinations of arguments default to returning an `Array`, but custom container types can define their own implementation and promotion-like rules to customize the result when they appear as arguments.

A special syntax exists for broadcasting: `f.(args...)` is equivalent to `broadcast(f, args...)`, and nested `f.(g.(args...))` calls are fused into a single broadcast loop.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6; 7 8; 9 10]
5×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2
 3   4
 5   6
 7   8
 9  10

julia> broadcast(+, A, B)
5×2 Matrix{Int64}:
  2   3
  5   6
  8   9
 11  12
 14  15

julia> parse.(Int, ["1", "2"])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> abs.((1, -2))
(1, 2)

julia> broadcast(+, 1.0, (0, -2.0))
(1.0, -1.0)

julia> (+).([[0,2], [1,3]], Ref{Vector{Int}}([1,-1]))
2-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]

julia> string.(("one","two","three","four"), ": ", 1:4)
4-element Vector{String}:
 "one: 1"
 "two: 2"
 "three: 3"
 "four: 4"

```
```
broadcast!(f, dest, As...)
```

Like [`broadcast`](@ref), but store the result of `broadcast(f, As...)` in the `dest` array. Note that `dest` is only used to store the result, and does not supply arguments to `f` unless it is also listed in the `As`, as in `broadcast!(f, A, A, B)` to perform `A[:] = broadcast(f, A, B)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1.0; 0.0]; B = [0.0; 0.0];

julia> broadcast!(+, B, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0

julia> broadcast!(+, A, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0
```
```
bswap(n)
```

Reverse the byte order of `n`.

(See also [`ntoh`](@ref) and [`hton`](@ref) to convert between the current native byte order and big-endian order.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = bswap(0x10203040)
0x40302010

julia> bswap(a)
0x10203040

julia> string(1, base = 2)
"1"

julia> string(bswap(1), base = 2)
"100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```
```
bytes2hex(itr) -> String
bytes2hex(io::IO, itr)
```

Convert an iterator `itr` of bytes to its hexadecimal string representation, either returning a `String` via `bytes2hex(itr)` or writing the string to an `io` stream via `bytes2hex(io, itr)`.  The hexadecimal characters are all lowercase.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `bytes2hex` with arbitrary iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `bytes2hex`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> b = hex2bytes(a)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> bytes2hex(b)
"3039"
```
```
bytesavailable(io)
```

Return the number of bytes available for reading before a read from this stream or buffer will block.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> bytesavailable(io)
34
```
```
cat(A...; dims)
```

Concatenate the input arrays along the specified dimensions in the iterable `dims`. For dimensions not in `dims`, all input arrays should have the same size, which will also be the size of the output array along that dimension. For dimensions in `dims`, the size of the output array is the sum of the sizes of the input arrays along that dimension. If `dims` is a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows one to construct block diagonal matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example, `cat(matrices...; dims=(1,2))` builds a block diagonal matrix, i.e. a block matrix with `matrices[1]`, `matrices[2]`, ... as diagonal blocks and matching zero blocks away from the diagonal.

See also [`hcat`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`hvcat`](@ref), [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cat([1 2; 3 4], [pi, pi], fill(10, 2,3,1); dims=2)
2×6×1 Array{Float64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1.0  2.0  3.14159  10.0  10.0  10.0
 3.0  4.0  3.14159  10.0  10.0  10.0

julia> cat(true, trues(2,2), trues(4)', dims=(1,2))
4×7 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  0  0  0  0  0  0
 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  1  1  1  1
```
```
catch_backtrace()
```

Get the backtrace of the current exception, for use within `catch` blocks.
```
cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```
```
cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Set the current working directory.

See also: [`pwd`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref), [`mkpath`](@ref), [`mktempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"

julia> cd()

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```

```
cd(f::Function, dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Temporarily change the current working directory to `dir`, apply function `f` and finally return to the original directory.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd(readdir, "/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")
34-element Array{String,1}:
 ".circleci"
 ".freebsdci.sh"

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```
```
ceil([T,] x)
ceil(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
ceil(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`ceil(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is greater than or equal to `x`.

`ceil(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
ceil(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` greater than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-09-01

julia> ceil(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:45:00

julia> ceil(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

```
ceil(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` up to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
3 weeks

julia> ceil(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> ceil(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Cvoid])
```

Obtain a pointer to a global variable in a C-exported shared library, specified exactly as in [`ccall`](@ref). Returns a `Ptr{Type}`, defaulting to `Ptr{Cvoid}` if no `Type` argument is supplied. The values can be read or written by [`unsafe_load`](@ref) or [`unsafe_store!`](@ref), respectively.
```
checkbounds(Bool, A, I...)
```

Return `true` if the specified indices `I` are in bounds for the given array `A`. Subtypes of `AbstractArray` should specialize this method if they need to provide custom bounds checking behaviors; however, in many cases one can rely on `A`'s indices and [`checkindex`](@ref).

See also [`checkindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = rand(3, 3);

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 2)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 3, 4)
false

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3, 2:4)
false
```

```
checkbounds(A, I...)
```

Throw an error if the specified indices `I` are not in bounds for the given array `A`.
```
checkindex(Bool, inds::AbstractUnitRange, index)
```

Return `true` if the given `index` is within the bounds of `inds`. Custom types that would like to behave as indices for all arrays can extend this method in order to provide a specialized bounds checking implementation.

See also [`checkbounds`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 8)
true

julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 21)
false
```
```
chmod(path::AbstractString, mode::Integer; recursive::Bool=false)
```

Change the permissions mode of `path` to `mode`. Only integer `mode`s (e.g. `0o777`) are currently supported. If `recursive=true` and the path is a directory all permissions in that directory will be recursively changed. Return `path`.

!!! note
    Prior to Julia 1.6, this did not correctly manipulate filesystem ACLs  on Windows, therefore it would only set read-only bits on files.  It  now is able to manipulate ACLs.

```
chomp(s::AbstractString) -> SubString
```

Remove a single trailing newline from a string.

See also [`chop`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chomp("Hello\n")
"Hello"
```
```
chop(s::AbstractString; head::Integer = 0, tail::Integer = 1)
```

Remove the first `head` and the last `tail` characters from `s`. The call `chop(s)` removes the last character from `s`. If it is requested to remove more characters than `length(s)` then an empty string is returned.

See also [`chomp`](@ref), [`startswith`](@ref), [`first`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "March"
"March"

julia> chop(a)
"Marc"

julia> chop(a, head = 1, tail = 2)
"ar"

julia> chop(a, head = 5, tail = 5)
""
```
```
chopprefix(s::AbstractString, prefix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the prefix `prefix` from `s`. If `s` does not start with `prefix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopsuffix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "Ham")
"burger"

julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chopsuffix(s::AbstractString, suffix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the suffix `suffix` from `s`. If `s` does not end with `suffix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopprefix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "er")
"Hamburg"

julia> chopsuffix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chown(path::AbstractString, owner::Integer, group::Integer=-1)
```

Change the owner and/or group of `path` to `owner` and/or `group`. If the value entered for `owner` or `group` is `-1` the corresponding ID will not change. Only integer `owner`s and `group`s are currently supported. Return `path`.
```
circcopy!(dest, src)
```

Copy `src` to `dest`, indexing each dimension modulo its length. `src` and `dest` must have the same size, but can be offset in their indices; any offset results in a (circular) wraparound. If the arrays have overlapping indices, then on the domain of the overlap `dest` agrees with `src`.

See also: [`circshift`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> src = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> dest = OffsetArray{Int}(undef, (0:3,2:5))

julia> circcopy!(dest, src)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices 0:3×2:5:
 8  12  16  4
 5   9  13  1
 6  10  14  2
 7  11  15  3

julia> dest[1:3,2:4] == src[1:3,2:4]
true
```
```
circshift(A, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in an array. The second argument is a tuple or vector giving the amount to shift in each dimension, or an integer to shift only in the first dimension.

See also: [`circshift!`](@ref), [`circcopy!`](@ref), [`bitrotate`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))

```
```
close(stream)
```

Close an I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first.

```
close(c::Channel[, excp::Exception])
```

Close a channel. An exception (optionally given by `excp`), is thrown by:

  * [`put!`](@ref) on a closed channel.
  * [`take!`](@ref) and [`fetch`](@ref) on an empty, closed channel.
```
closewrite(stream)
```

Shutdown the write half of a full-duplex I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first. Notify the other end that no more data will be written to the underlying file. This is not supported by all IO types.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = Base.BufferStream(); # this never blocks, so we can read and write on the same Task

julia> write(io, "request");

julia> # calling `read(io)` here would block forever

julia> closewrite(io);

julia> read(io, String)
"request"
```
```
cmp(x,y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. Uses the total order implemented by `isless`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp(1, 2)
-1

julia> cmp(2, 1)

[...]
```

```
cmp(<, x, y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. The first argument specifies a less-than comparison function to use.

```
cmp(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Compare two strings. Return `0` if both strings have the same length and the character at each index is the same in both strings. Return `-1` if `a` is a prefix of `b`, or if `a` comes before `b` in alphabetical order. Return `1` if `b` is a prefix of `a`, or if `b` comes before `a` in alphabetical order (technically, lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp("abc", "abc")
0

julia> cmp("ab", "abc")
-1

julia> cmp("abc", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("ab", "ac")
-1

julia> cmp("ac", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("α", "a")
1

julia> cmp("b", "β")
-1
```
```
coalesce(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`missing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise return `missing`.

See also [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref), [`@coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> coalesce(missing, 1)
1

julia> coalesce(1, missing)
1

julia> coalesce(nothing, 1)  # returns `nothing`

julia> coalesce(missing, missing)
missing
```
```
code_lowered(f, types; generated=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Return an array of the lowered forms (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

If `generated` is `false`, the returned `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to fallback implementations. An error is thrown if no fallback implementation exists. If `generated` is `true`, these `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to the method bodies yielded by expanding the generators.

The keyword `debuginfo` controls the amount of code metadata present in the output.

Note that an error will be thrown if `types` are not leaf types when `generated` is `true` and any of the corresponding methods are an `@generated` method.
```
code_typed(f, types; kw...)
```

Returns an array of type-inferred lowered form (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

# Keyword Arguments

  * `optimize=true`: controls whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied.
  * `debuginfo=:default`: controls the amount of code metadata present in the output,

possible options are `:source` or `:none`.

# Internal Keyword Arguments

This section should be considered internal, and is only for who understands Julia compiler internals.

  * `world=Base.get_world_counter()`: optional, controls the world age to use when looking up methods,

use current world age if not specified.

  * `interp=Core.Compiler.NativeInterpreter(world)`: optional, controls the interpreter to use,

use the native interpreter Julia uses if not specified.

# Example

One can put the argument types in a tuple to get the corresponding `code_typed`.

```julia
julia> code_typed(+, (Float64, Float64))
1-element Vector{Any}:
 CodeInfo(
1 ─ %1 = Base.add_float(x, y)::Float64
└──      return %1
) => Float64
```
```
codepoint(c::AbstractChar) -> Integer
```

Return the Unicode codepoint (an unsigned integer) corresponding to the character `c` (or throw an exception if `c` does not represent a valid character). For `Char`, this is a `UInt32` value, but `AbstractChar` types that represent only a subset of Unicode may return a different-sized integer (e.g. `UInt8`).
```
codeunit(s::AbstractString) -> Type{<:Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}}
```

Return the code unit type of the given string object. For ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8 encoded strings, this would be `UInt8`; for UCS-2 and UTF-16 it would be `UInt16`; for UTF-32 it would be `UInt32`. The code unit type need not be limited to these three types, but it's hard to think of widely used string encodings that don't use one of these units. `codeunit(s)` is the same as `typeof(codeunit(s,1))` when `s` is a non-empty string.

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref).

```
codeunit(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}
```

Return the code unit value in the string `s` at index `i`. Note that

```
codeunit(s, i) :: codeunit(s)
```

I.e. the value returned by `codeunit(s, i)` is of the type returned by `codeunit(s)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = codeunit("Hello", 2)
0x65

julia> typeof(a)
UInt8
```

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
codeunits(s::AbstractString)
```

Obtain a vector-like object containing the code units of a string. Returns a `CodeUnits` wrapper by default, but `codeunits` may optionally be defined for new string types if necessary.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> codeunits("Juλia")
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x4a
 0x75
 0xce
 0xbb
 0x69
 0x61
```
```
collect(element_type, collection)
```

Return an `Array` with the given element type of all items in a collection or iterable. The result has the same shape and number of dimensions as `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(Float64, 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 3.0
 5.0
```

```
collect(collection)
```

Return an `Array` of all items in a collection or iterator. For dictionaries, returns `Pair{KeyType, ValType}`. If the argument is array-like or is an iterator with the [`HasShape`](@ref IteratorSize) trait, the result will have the same shape and number of dimensions as the argument.

Used by comprehensions to turn a generator into an `Array`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(1:2:13)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
 11

4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  9
 25
 49
```
```
complex(r, [i])
```

Convert real numbers or arrays to complex. `i` defaults to zero.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(7)
7 + 0im

julia> complex([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 2 + 0im
 3 + 0im
```

```
complex(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type which can represent a value of type `T` as a complex number. Equivalent to `typeof(complex(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(Complex{Int})
Complex{Int64}

julia> complex(Int)
Complex{Int64}
```
```
conj(z)
```

Compute the complex conjugate of a complex number `z`.

See also: [`angle`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj(1 + 3im)
1 - 3im
```

```
conj(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the complex conjugate of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `conj.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 0 - 2im
 3 - 4im

julia> conj(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Complex{Int64}, 0}:
2 + 1im
```
```
conj!(A)
```

Transform an array to its complex conjugate in-place.

See also [`conj`](@ref).

2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1-1im  2+1im
 2-2im  3-1im
```
```
contains(haystack::AbstractString, needle)
```

Return `true` if `haystack` contains `needle`. This is the same as `occursin(needle, haystack)`, but is provided for consistency with `startswith(haystack, needle)` and `endswith(haystack, needle)`.

See also [`occursin`](@ref), [`in`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", "Julia")
true

julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", 'a')
true

julia> contains("aba", r"a.a")
true

julia> contains("abba", r"a.a")
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `contains` function requires at least Julia 1.5.


```
contains(needle)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument contains `needle`, i.e. a function equivalent to `haystack -> contains(haystack, needle)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(contains)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
No documentation found.

Binding `contractuser` does not exist.
```
convert(T, x)
```

Convert `x` to a value of type `T`.

If `T` is an [`Integer`](@ref) type, an [`InexactError`](@ref) will be raised if `x` is not representable by `T`, for example if `x` is not integer-valued, or is outside the range supported by `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> convert(Int, 3.0)
3

julia> convert(Int, 3.5)
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(3.5)
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

If `T` is a [`AbstractFloat`](@ref) type, then it will return the closest value to `x` representable by `T`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1/3
0.3333333333333333

julia> convert(Float32, x)
0.33333334f0

julia> convert(BigFloat, x)
0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125
```

If `T` is a collection type and `x` a collection, the result of `convert(T, x)` may alias all or part of `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = Int[1, 2, 3];

julia> y = convert(Vector{Int}, x);

julia> y === x
true
```

See also: [`round`](@ref), [`trunc`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`reinterpret`](@ref).
```
copy(x)
```

Create a shallow copy of `x`: the outer structure is copied, but not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a new array with identically-same elements as the original.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copyto!`](@ref).

```
copy(A::Transpose)
copy(A::Adjoint)
```

Eagerly evaluate the lazy matrix transpose/adjoint. Note that the transposition is applied recursively to elements.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2im; -3im 4]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0+2im
 0-3im  4+0im

julia> T = transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:

 0+2im  4+0im

julia> copy(T)
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im
```
```
copy!(dst, src) -> dst
```

In-place [`copy`](@ref) of `src` into `dst`, discarding any pre-existing elements in `dst`. If `dst` and `src` are of the same type, `dst == src` should hold after the call. If `dst` and `src` are multidimensional arrays, they must have equal [`axes`](@ref).

See also [`copyto!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 this method is available from the `Future` standard library as `Future.copy!`.

```
copysign(x, y) -> z
```

Return `z` which has the magnitude of `x` and the same sign as `y`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> copysign(1, -2)
-1

julia> copysign(-1, 2)
1
```
```
copyto!(dest, do, src, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from collection `src` starting at offset `so`, to array `dest` starting at offset `do`. Return `dest`.

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractArray, src) -> dest
```

Copy all elements from collection `src` to array `dest`, whose length must be greater than or equal to the length `n` of `src`. The first `n` elements of `dest` are overwritten, the other elements are left untouched.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copy`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1., 0., 3., 0., 5.];

copyto!(dest, Rdest::CartesianIndices, src, Rsrc::CartesianIndices) -> dest
```

Copy the block of `src` in the range of `Rsrc` to the block of `dest` in the range of `Rdest`. The sizes of the two regions must match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(5, 5);

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> Ainds = CartesianIndices((2:3, 2:3));

julia> Binds = CartesianIndices(B);

copyto!(dest::AbstractMatrix, src::UniformScaling)
```

Copies a [`UniformScaling`](@ref) onto a matrix.

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`cosd`], [`cospi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
cos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the cosine. Otherwise, the cosine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

```
```
cosc(x)
```

Compute $\cos(\pi x) / x - \sin(\pi x) / (\pi x^2)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$. This is the derivative of `sinc(x)`.
```
cosd(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

```
count([f=identity,] itr; init=0) -> Integer
```

Count the number of elements in `itr` for which the function `f` returns `true`. If `f` is omitted, count the number of `true` elements in `itr` (which should be a collection of boolean values). `init` optionally specifies the value to start counting from and therefore also determines the output type.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


See also: [`any`](@ref), [`sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

```

```
count(
    pattern::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return the number of matches for `pattern` in `string`. This is equivalent to calling `length(findall(pattern, string))` but more efficient.

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a character as the pattern requires at least Julia 1.7.

```
```
countlines(io::IO; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
```

Read `io` until the end of the stream/file and count the number of lines. To specify a file pass the filename as the first argument. EOL markers other than `'\n'` are supported by passing them as the second argument.  The last non-empty line of `io` is counted even if it does not end with the EOL, matching the length returned by [`eachline`](@ref) and [`readlines`](@ref).

To count lines of a `String`, `countlines(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> eof(io) # counting lines moves the file pointer
true

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io, eol = '.')
1
```
```
cp(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, follow_symlinks::Bool=false)
```

Copy the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`.

If `follow_symlinks=false`, and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be created as a symbolic link. If `follow_symlinks=true` and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be a copy of the file or directory `src` refers to. Return `dst`.

!!! note
    The `cp` function is different from the `cp` command. The `cp` function always operates on the assumption that `dst` is a file, while the command does different things depending on whether `dst` is a directory or a file. Using `force=true` when `dst` is a directory will result in loss of all the contents present in the `dst` directory, and `dst` will become a file that has the contents of `src` instead.

```
csc(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
csc(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosecant of a square matrix `A`.
```
cscd(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
csch(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cosecant of `x`.

```
csch(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cosecant of square matrix `A`.
```
ctime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).ctime`.
```
cumprod(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product along the dimension `dim`. See also [`cumprod!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Int8[1 2 3; 4 5 6];

julia> cumprod(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2   3

julia> cumprod(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2    6
 4  20  120
```

```
cumprod(itr)
```

Cumulative product of an iterator.

See also [`cumprod!`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref), [`cumsum`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumprod` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumprod(fill(1//2, 3))
3-element Vector{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//2
 1//4
 1//8

julia> cumprod((1, 2, 1, 3, 1))
(1, 2, 2, 6, 6)

julia> cumprod("julia")
5-element Vector{String}:
 "j"
 "ju"
 "jul"
 "juli"
 "julia"
```
```
cumprod!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).

```
cumprod!(y::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)
```

Cumulative product of a vector `x`, storing the result in `y`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).
```
cumsum(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum along the dimension `dims`. See also [`cumsum!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> cumsum(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 5  7  9

julia> cumsum(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3   6
 4  9  15
```

!!! note
    The return array's `eltype` is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size  and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size. To preserve `eltype` of arrays with small signed or unsigned integer `accumulate(+, A)` should be used.

    ```jldoctest
    julia> cumsum(Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int64}:
     100
     128

    julia> accumulate(+,Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int8}:
      100
     -128
    ```

    In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is `Int64[100, 128]`. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in `Int8[100, -128]`.


```
cumsum(itr)
```

Cumulative sum of an iterator.

See also [`accumulate`](@ref) to apply functions other than `+`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumsum` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]
 [3, 3]
```
```
cumsum!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumsum`](@ref).
```
current_exceptions(task::Task=current_task(); [backtrace::Bool=true])
```

Get the stack of exceptions currently being handled. For nested catch blocks there may be more than one current exception in which case the most recently thrown exception is last in the stack. The stack is returned as an `ExceptionStack` which is an AbstractVector of named tuples `(exception,backtrace)`. If `backtrace` is false, the backtrace in each pair will be set to `nothing`.

Explicitly passing `task` will return the current exception stack on an arbitrary task. This is useful for inspecting tasks which have failed due to uncaught exceptions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function went by the experimental name `catch_stack()` in Julia 1.1–1.6, and had a plain Vector-of-tuples as a return type.

```
current_task()
```

Get the currently running [`Task`](@ref).
```
deepcopy(x)
```

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::IdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
```
deg2rad(x)
```

Convert `x` from degrees to radians.

See also: [`rad2deg`](@ref), [`sind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deg2rad(90)
1.5707963267948966
```
```
delete!(collection, key)
```

Delete the mapping for the given key in a collection, if any, and return the collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b")
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b") # d is left unchanged
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1
```
```
deleteat!(a::Vector, i::Integer)
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

See also: [`delete!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 2)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
deleteat!(a::Vector, inds)
```

Remove the items at the indices given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

`inds` can be either an iterator or a collection of sorted and unique integer indices, or a boolean vector of the same length as `a` with `true` indicating entries to delete.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:

Denominator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

```
```
detach(command)
```

Mark a command object so that it will be run in a new process group, allowing it to outlive the julia process, and not have Ctrl-C interrupts passed to it.
```
diff(A::AbstractVector)
diff(A::AbstractArray; dims::Integer)
```

Finite difference operator on a vector or a multidimensional array `A`. In the latter case the dimension to operate on needs to be specified with the `dims` keyword argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `diff` for arrays with dimension higher than 2 requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [2 4; 6 16]

```
digits([T<:Integer], n::Integer; base::T = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Return an array with element type `T` (default `Int`) of the digits of `n` in the given base, optionally padded with zeros to a specified size. More significant digits are at higher indices, such that `n == sum(digits[k]*base^(k-1) for k=1:length(digits))`.

See also [`ndigits`](@ref), [`digits!`](@ref), and for base 2 also [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> n == evalpoly(13, digits(n, base = 13))
true
```
```
digits!(array, n::Integer; base::Integer = 10)
```

Fills an array of the digits of `n` in the given base. More significant digits are at higher indices. If the array length is insufficient, the least significant digits are filled up to the array length. If the array length is excessive, the excess portion is filled with zeros.

# Examples

```
dirname(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the directory part of a path. Trailing characters ('/' or '\') in the path are counted as part of the path.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dirname("/home/myuser")
"/home"

julia> dirname("/home/myuser/")
"/home/myuser"
```

See also [`basename`](@ref).
```
disable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Disable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function on the current task, for calling external code that may call julia code that is not interrupt safe. Intended to be called using `do` block syntax as follows:

```
disable_sigint() do
    # interrupt-unsafe code
    ...
end
```

This is not needed on worker threads (`Threads.threadid() != 1`) since the `InterruptException` will only be delivered to the master thread. External functions that do not call julia code or julia runtime automatically disable sigint during their execution.
```
diskstat(path=pwd())
```

Returns statistics in bytes about the disk that contains the file or directory pointed at by `path`. If no argument is passed, statistics about the disk that contains the current working directory are returned.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
display(x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
display(mime, x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

Display `x` using the topmost applicable display in the display stack, typically using the richest supported multimedia output for `x`, with plain-text [`stdout`](@ref) output as a fallback. The `display(d, x)` variant attempts to display `x` on the given display `d` only, throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if `d` cannot display objects of this type.

In general, you cannot assume that `display` output goes to `stdout` (unlike [`print(x)`](@ref) or [`show(x)`](@ref)).  For example, `display(x)` may open up a separate window with an image. `display(x)` means "show `x` in the best way you can for the current output device(s)." If you want REPL-like text output that is guaranteed to go to `stdout`, use [`show(stdout, "text/plain", x)`](@ref) instead.

There are also two variants with a `mime` argument (a MIME type string, such as `"image/png"`), which attempt to display `x` using the requested MIME type *only*, throwing a `MethodError` if this type is not supported by either the display(s) or by `x`. With these variants, one can also supply the "raw" data in the requested MIME type by passing `x::AbstractString` (for MIME types with text-based storage, such as text/html or application/postscript) or `x::Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types).

To customize how instances of a type are displayed, overload [`show`](@ref) rather than `display`, as explained in the manual section on [custom pretty-printing](@ref man-custom-pretty-printing).
```
displayable(mime) -> Bool
displayable(d::AbstractDisplay, mime) -> Bool
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given `mime` type (string) is displayable by any of the displays in the current display stack, or specifically by the display `d` in the second variant.
```
displaysize([io::IO]) -> (lines, columns)
```

Return the nominal size of the screen that may be used for rendering output to this `IO` object. If no input is provided, the environment variables `LINES` and `COLUMNS` are read. If those are not set, a default size of `(24, 80)` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> withenv("LINES" => 30, "COLUMNS" => 100) do
           displaysize()
       end
(30, 100)
```

To get your TTY size,

```julia-repl
julia> displaysize(stdout)
(34, 147)
```
```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

# Examples:

```
```
divrem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient and remainder from Euclidean division. Equivalent to `(div(x,y,r), rem(x,y,r))`. Equivalently, with the default value of `r`, this call is equivalent to `(x÷y, x%y)`.

See also: [`fldmod`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref).

```
```
download(url::AbstractString, [path::AbstractString = tempname()]) -> path
```

Download a file from the given url, saving it to the location `path`, or if not specified, a temporary path. Returns the path of the downloaded file.

!!! note
    Since Julia 1.6, this function is deprecated and is just a thin wrapper around `Downloads.download`. In new code, you should use that function directly instead of calling this.

```
dropdims(A; dims)
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with the dimensions specified by `dims` removed. `size(A,d)` must equal 1 for every `d` in `dims`, and repeated dimensions or numbers outside `1:ndims(A)` are forbidden.

The result shares the same underlying data as `A`, such that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

See also: [`reshape`](@ref), [`vec`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

```
```
dump(x; maxdepth=8)
```

Show every part of the representation of a value. The depth of the output is truncated at `maxdepth`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct
           x
           y

```
eachcol(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the second dimension of matrix `A`, returning the columns as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref) and [`eachslice`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

 [1, 3]
 [2, 4]
```
```
eachindex(A...)
```

Create an iterable object for visiting each index of an `AbstractArray` `A` in an efficient manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, return a specialized Cartesian range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, return an iterator object supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

If you supply more than one `AbstractArray` argument, `eachindex` will create an iterable object that is fast for all arguments (a [`UnitRange`](@ref) if all inputs have fast linear indexing, a [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) otherwise). If the arrays have different sizes and/or dimensionalities, a `DimensionMismatch` exception will be thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> for i in eachindex(A) # linear indexing
           println(i)
       end

CartesianIndex(1, 1)
CartesianIndex(2, 1)
```
```
eachline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
eachline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Create an iterable `EachLine` object that will yield each line from an I/O stream or a file. Iteration calls [`readline`](@ref) on the stream argument repeatedly with `keep` passed through, determining whether trailing end-of-line characters are retained. When called with a file name, the file is opened once at the beginning of iteration and closed at the end. If iteration is interrupted, the file will be closed when the `EachLine` object is garbage collected.

To iterate over each line of a `String`, `eachline(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

[`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) can be used on an `EachLine` object to read the lines in reverse order (for files, buffers, and other I/O streams supporting [`seek`](@ref)), and [`first`](@ref) or [`last`](@ref) can be used to extract the initial or final lines, respectively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> for line in eachline("my_file.txt")
           print(line)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members.

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Julia 1.8 is required to use `Iterators.reverse` or `last` with `eachline` iterators.

```
eachmatch(r::Regex, s::AbstractString; overlap::Bool=false)
```

Search for all matches of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return an iterator over the matches. If `overlap` is `true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from distinct character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a.a"
r"a.a"

julia> m = eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a")
Base.RegexMatchIterator(r"a.a", "a1a2a3a", false)

julia> collect(m)
2-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")

julia> collect(eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a", overlap = true))
3-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a2a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")
```
```
eachrow(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the first dimension of vector or matrix `A`, returning the rows as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref).

```
```
eachslice(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Create a generator that iterates over dimensions `dims` of `A`, returning views that select all the data from the other dimensions in `A`.

Only a single dimension in `dims` is currently supported. Equivalent to `(view(A,:,:,...,i,:,: ...)) for i in axes(A, dims))`, where `i` is in position `dims`.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref), [`eachcol`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), and [`selectdim`](@ref).

```
eachsplit(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
eachsplit(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm` and return an iterator over the substrings.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`split`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `eachsplit` function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> collect(eachsplit(a, "."))
2-element Vector{SubString}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
eltype(type)
```

Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating a collection of the given `type`. For dictionary types, this will be a `Pair{KeyType,ValType}`. The definition `eltype(x) = eltype(typeof(x))` is provided for convenience so that instances can be passed instead of types. However the form that accepts a type argument should be defined for new types.

See also: [`keytype`](@ref), [`typeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eltype(fill(1f0, (2,2)))
Float32

julia> eltype(fill(0x1, (2,2)))
UInt8
```
```
empty(x::Tuple)
```

Returns an empty tuple, `()`.

```
empty(v::AbstractVector, [eltype])
```

Create an empty vector similar to `v`, optionally changing the `eltype`.

See also: [`empty!`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
Float64[]

julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], String)
String[]
```

```
empty(a::AbstractDict, [index_type=keytype(a)], [value_type=valtype(a)])
```

Create an empty `AbstractDict` container which can accept indices of type `index_type` and values of type `value_type`. The second and third arguments are optional and default to the input's `keytype` and `valtype`, respectively. (If only one of the two types is specified, it is assumed to be the `value_type`, and the `index_type` we default to `keytype(a)`).

Custom `AbstractDict` subtypes may choose which specific dictionary type is best suited to return for the given index and value types, by specializing on the three-argument signature. The default is to return an empty `Dict`.
```
empty!(collection) -> collection
```

Remove all elements from a `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> empty!(A);

julia> A
Dict{String, Int64}()
```
```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with `suffix`. If `suffix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the last character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`startswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("Sunday", "day")
true
```

```
endswith(suffix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument ends with `suffix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> endswith(y, suffix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(endswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `endswith(suffix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith_julia = endswith("Julia");

julia> endswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> endswith_julia("JuliaLang")
false
```

```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with the regex pattern, `suffix`.

!!! note
    `endswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"...$", s)` is faster than `endswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`startswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("JuliaLang", r"Lang|Roberts")
true
```
```
enumerate(iter)
```

An iterator that yields `(i, x)` where `i` is a counter starting at 1, and `x` is the `i`th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values `x` over which you are iterating, but also the number of iterations so far. Note that `i` may not be valid for indexing `iter`; it's also possible that `x != iter[i]`, if `iter` has indices that do not start at 1. See the `pairs(IndexLinear(), iter)` method if you want to ensure that `i` is an index.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
```
```
eof(stream) -> Bool
```

Test whether an I/O stream is at end-of-file. If the stream is not yet exhausted, this function will block to wait for more data if necessary, and then return `false`. Therefore it is always safe to read one byte after seeing `eof` return `false`. `eof` will return `false` as long as buffered data is still available, even if the remote end of a connection is closed.
```
eps(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractFloat
eps()
```

Return the *machine epsilon* of the floating point type `T` (`T = Float64` by default). This is defined as the gap between 1 and the next largest value representable by `typeof(one(T))`, and is equivalent to `eps(one(T))`.  (Since `eps(T)` is a bound on the *relative error* of `T`, it is a "dimensionless" quantity like [`one`](@ref).)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps()
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(Float32)
1.1920929f-7

julia> 1.0 + eps()
1.0000000000000002

julia> 1.0 + eps()/2
1.0
```

```
eps(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the *unit in last place* (ulp) of `x`. This is the distance between consecutive representable floating point values at `x`. In most cases, if the distance on either side of `x` is different, then the larger of the two is taken, that is

```
eps(x) == max(x-prevfloat(x), nextfloat(x)-x)
```

The exceptions to this rule are the smallest and largest finite values (e.g. `nextfloat(-Inf)` and `prevfloat(Inf)` for [`Float64`](@ref)), which round to the smaller of the values.

The rationale for this behavior is that `eps` bounds the floating point rounding error. Under the default `RoundNearest` rounding mode, if $y$ is a real number and $x$ is the nearest floating point number to $y$, then

$$
|y-x| \leq \operatorname{eps}(x)/2.
$$

See also: [`nextfloat`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref), [`floatmax`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(1.0)
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(prevfloat(2.0))
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(2.0)
4.440892098500626e-16

julia> x = prevfloat(Inf)      # largest finite Float64
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> x + eps(x)/2            # rounds up
Inf

julia> x + prevfloat(eps(x)/2) # rounds down
1.7976931348623157e308
```

```
eps(::Type{DateTime}) -> Millisecond
eps(::Type{Date}) -> Day
eps(::Type{Time}) -> Nanosecond
eps(::TimeType) -> Period
```

Return the smallest unit value supported by the `TimeType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(DateTime)
1 millisecond

julia> eps(Date)
1 day

julia> eps(Time)
1 nanosecond
```
```
error(message::AbstractString)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.

```
error(msg...)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.
```
errormonitor(t::Task)
```

Print an error log to `stderr` if task `t` fails.
```
esc(e)
```

Only valid in the context of an [`Expr`](@ref) returned from a macro. Prevents the macro hygiene pass from turning embedded variables into gensym variables. See the [Macros](@ref man-macros) section of the Metaprogramming chapter of the manual for more details and examples.
```
escape_string(str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::AbstractString
escape_string(io, str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::Nothing
```

General escaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`.

Backslashes (`\`) are escaped with a double-backslash (`"\\"`). Non-printable characters are escaped either with their standard C escape codes, `"\0"` for NUL (if unambiguous), unicode code point (`"\u"` prefix) or hex (`"\x"` prefix).

The optional `esc` argument specifies any additional characters that should also be escaped by a prepending backslash (`"` is also escaped by default in the first form).

The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which are to be kept as they are. Notice that `esc` has precedence here.

See also [`unescape_string`](@ref) for the reverse operation.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The `keep` argument is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb")
"aaa\\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb"; keep = '\n')
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("\xfe\xff") # invalid utf-8
"\\xfe\\xff"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0')) # unambiguous
"ℵ\\0"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0','0')) # \0 would be ambiguous
"ℵ\\x000"
```
```
evalfile(path::AbstractString, args::Vector{String}=String[])
```

Load the file using [`include`](@ref), evaluate all expressions, and return the value of the last one.
```
evalpoly(x, p)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k x^{k-1} p[k]$ for the coefficients `p[1]`, `p[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `x`. Loops are unrolled at compile time if the number of coefficients is statically known, i.e. when `p` is a `Tuple`. This function generates efficient code using Horner's method if `x` is real, or using a Goertzel-like [^DK62] algorithm if `x` is complex.

[^DK62]: Donald Knuth, Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2: Seminumerical Algorithms, Sec. 4.6.4.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    This function requires Julia 1.4 or later.


# Example

```jldoctest
julia> evalpoly(2, (1, 2, 3))
17
```
```
exit(code=0)
```

Stop the program with an exit code. The default exit code is zero, indicating that the program completed successfully. In an interactive session, `exit()` can be called with the keyboard shortcut `^D`.
```
exp(x)
```

Compute the natural base exponential of `x`, in other words $ℯ^x$.

See also [`exp2`](@ref), [`exp10`](@ref) and [`cis`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> exp(1.0)

julia> exp(im * pi) ≈ cis(pi)
true
```

```
exp(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix exponential of `A`, defined by

$$
e^A = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^n}{n!}.
$$

For symmetric or Hermitian `A`, an eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, otherwise the scaling and squaring algorithm (see [^H05]) is chosen.

julia> exp2(63) > typemax(Int)
true
```
```
expanduser(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

On Unix systems, replace a tilde character at the start of a path with the current user's home directory.
```
expm1(x)
```

Accurately compute $e^x-1$. It avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small values of x.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> expm1(1e-16)
1.0e-16

julia> exp(1e-16) - 1

```
```
exponent(x::AbstractFloat) -> Int
```

Get the exponent of a normalized floating-point number. Returns the largest integer `y` such that `2^y ≤ abs(x)`.

julia> exponent(6.5)
2

julia> exponent(16.0)

```
```
extrema(itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` element in a single pass, and return them as a 2-tuple.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). As a consequence, when `itr` is empty the returned `(mn, mx)` tuple will satisfy `mn ≥ mx`. When `init` is specified it may be used even for non-empty `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.8 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> extrema(2:10)
(2, 10)

julia> extrema([9,pi,4.5])
(3.141592653589793, 9.0)

julia> extrema([]; init = (Inf, -Inf))
(Inf, -Inf)
```

```
extrema(f, itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` of `f` applied to each element in `itr` and return them as a 2-tuple. Only one pass is made over `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). It is used for non-empty collections. Note: it implies that, for empty `itr`, the returned value `(mn, mx)` satisfies `mn ≥ mx` even though for non-empty `itr` it  satisfies `mn ≤ mx`.  This is a "paradoxical" but yet expected result.

```
factorial(n::Integer)
```

Factorial of `n`. If `n` is an [`Integer`](@ref), the factorial is computed as an integer (promoted to at least 64 bits). Note that this may overflow if `n` is not small, but you can use `factorial(big(n))` to compute the result exactly in arbitrary precision.

See also [`binomial`](@ref).

# Examples

```
fd(stream)
```

Return the file descriptor backing the stream or file. Note that this function only applies to synchronous `File`'s and `IOStream`'s not to any of the asynchronous streams.
```
fdio([name::AbstractString, ]fd::Integer[, own::Bool=false]) -> IOStream
```

Create an [`IOStream`](@ref) object from an integer file descriptor. If `own` is `true`, closing this object will close the underlying descriptor. By default, an `IOStream` is closed when it is garbage collected. `name` allows you to associate the descriptor with a named file.
```
fetch(c::Channel)
```

Wait for and get the first available item from the channel. Does not remove the item. `fetch` is unsupported on an unbuffered (0-size) channel.

```
fetch(t::Task)
```

Wait for a Task to finish, then return its result value. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.

```
fetch(x::Future)
```

Wait for and get the value of a [`Future`](@ref). The fetched value is cached locally. Further calls to `fetch` on the same reference return the cached value. If the remote value is an exception, throws a [`RemoteException`](@ref) which captures the remote exception and backtrace.

```
fetch(c::RemoteChannel)
```

Wait for and get a value from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). Exceptions raised are the same as for a [`Future`](@ref). Does not remove the item fetched.
```
fieldcount(t::Type)
```

Get the number of fields that an instance of the given type would have. An error is thrown if the type is too abstract to determine this.
```
fieldname(x::DataType, i::Integer)
```

Get the name of field `i` of a `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

(:num, :den)

julia> fieldnames(typeof(1+im))
(:re, :im)
```
```
fieldoffset(type, i)
```

The byte offset of field `i` of a type relative to the data start. For example, we could use it in the following manner to summarize information about a struct:

```jldoctest
julia> structinfo(T) = [(fieldoffset(T,i), fieldname(T,i), fieldtype(T,i)) for i = 1:fieldcount(T)];

```
```
fieldtypes(T::Type)
```

The declared types of all fields in a composite DataType `T` as a tuple.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> fieldtypes(Foo)
(Int64, String)
```
```
filemode(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mode`.
```
filesize(path...)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).size`.
```
fill(value, dims::Tuple)
fill(value, dims...)
```

Create an array of size `dims` with every location set to `value`.

For example, `fill(1.0, (5,5))` returns a 5×5 array of floats, with `1.0` in every location of the array.

The dimension lengths `dims` may be specified as either a tuple or a sequence of arguments. An `N`-length tuple or `N` arguments following the `value` specify an `N`-dimensional array. Thus, a common idiom for creating a zero-dimensional array with its only location set to `x` is `fill(x)`.

Every location of the returned array is set to (and is thus [`===`](@ref) to) the `value` that was passed; this means that if the `value` is itself modified, all elements of the `fill`ed array will reflect that modification because they're *still* that very `value`. This is of no concern with `fill(1.0, (5,5))` as the `value` `1.0` is immutable and cannot itself be modified, but can be unexpected with mutable values like — most commonly — arrays.  For example, `fill([], 3)` places *the very same* empty array in all three locations of the returned vector:

```jldoctest
julia> v = fill([], 3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v[1] === v[2] === v[3]
true

julia> value = v[1]
Any[]

julia> push!(value, 867_5309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
```

To create an array of many independent inner arrays, use a [comprehension](@ref man-comprehensions) instead. This creates a new and distinct array on each iteration of the loop:

```jldoctest
julia> v2 = [[] for _ in 1:3]
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v2[1] === v2[2] === v2[3]
false

julia> push!(v2[1], 8675309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v2
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 []
 []
```

```
fill!(A, x)
```

Fill array `A` with the value `x`. If `x` is an object reference, all elements will refer to the same object. `fill!(A, Foo())` will return `A` filled with the result of evaluating `Foo()` once.

filter(f, a)
```

Return a copy of collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Support for `a` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.4.

julia> filter(isodd, a)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Return a copy of `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b")
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  2 => "b"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 1 entry:
  1 => "a"
```

```
filter(f, itr::SkipMissing{<:AbstractArray})
```

Return a vector similar to the array wrapped by the given `SkipMissing` iterator but with all missing elements and those for which `f` returns `false` removed.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1 2; missing 4]
2×2 Matrix{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1         2
  missing  4

julia> filter(isodd, skipmissing(x))
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```
```
filter!(f, a)
```

Update collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> filter!(isodd, Vector(1:10))
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter!(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Update `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b", 3=>"c")
Dict{Int64, String} with 3 entries:
  2 => "b"
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter!(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"
```
```
finalize(x)
```

Immediately run finalizers registered for object `x`.
```
finalizer(f, x)
```

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to `x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the behavior of this function is unpredictable.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`. Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or `ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

# Examples

```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing $x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

# Example

```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing $t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```
```
findall(f::Function, A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the indices or keys of `A` where `f(A[I])` returns `true`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

julia> findall(x -> x >= 0, d)
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :A

```

```
findall(A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the `true` indices or keys of `A`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return a `Vector{UnitRange{Int}}` of all the matches for `pattern` in `string`. Each element of the returned vector is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, like the return value of [`findnext`](@ref).

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

# Examples

findfirst(A)
```

Return the index or key of the first `true` value in `A`. Return `nothing` if no such value is found. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> first(["foo", "bar", "qux"], 2)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "foo"
 "bar"

julia> first(1:6, 10)
1:6

julia> first(Bool[], 1)
Bool[]
```

```
first(s::AbstractString, n::Integer)
```

Get a string consisting of the first `n` characters of `s`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> first("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 0)
""

julia> first("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 1)
"∀"

julia> first("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 3)
"∀ϵ≠"
```
```
firstindex(collection) -> Integer
firstindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the first index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the first index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[begin]` and `A[1, begin]` lower to `A[firstindex(A)]` and `A[1, firstindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`first`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> firstindex([1,2,4])
1

julia> firstindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
1
```
```
fld(x, y)
```

Largest integer less than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundDown)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fld(7.3,5.5)
1.0

julia> fld.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -2  -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

Because `fld(x, y)` implements strictly correct floored rounding based on the true value of floating-point numbers, unintuitive situations can arise. For example:

```jldoctest
julia> fld(6.0,0.1)
59.0
julia> 6.0/0.1
60.0
julia> 6.0/big(0.1)
59.99999999999999666933092612453056361837965690217069245739573412231113406246995
```

What is happening here is that the true value of the floating-point number written as `0.1` is slightly larger than the numerical value 1/10 while `6.0` represents the number 6 precisely. Therefore the true value of `6.0 / 0.1` is slightly less than 60. When doing division, this is rounded to precisely `60.0`, but `fld(6.0, 0.1)` always takes the floor of the true value, so the result is `59.0`.
```
fld1(x, y)
```

Flooring division, returning a value consistent with `mod1(x,y)`

See also [`mod1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> fld1(x, y)
4

julia> x == fld(x, y) * y + mod(x, y)
true

julia> x == (fld1(x, y) - 1) * y + mod1(x, y)
true
```
```
fldmod(x, y)
```

The floored quotient and modulus after division. A convenience wrapper for `divrem(x, y, RoundDown)`. Equivalent to `(fld(x,y), mod(x,y))`.

See also: [`fld`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).
```
fldmod1(x, y)
```

Return `(fld1(x,y), mod1(x,y))`.

See also [`fld1`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref).
```
flipsign(x, y)
```

Return `x` with its sign flipped if `y` is negative. For example `abs(x) = flipsign(x,x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> flipsign(5, 3)
5

julia> flipsign(5, -3)
-5
```
```
float(x)
```

Convert a number or array to a floating point data type.

See also: [`complex`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`convert`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(1:1000)
1.0:1.0:1000.0

julia> float(typemax(Int32))
2.147483647e9
```

```
float(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type to represent a value of type `T` as a floating point value. Equivalent to `typeof(float(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(Complex{Int})
ComplexF64 (alias for Complex{Float64})

julia> float(Int)
Float64
```
```
floatmax(T = Float64)
```

Return the largest finite number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

See also: [`typemax`](@ref), [`floatmin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmax(Float16)
Float16(6.55e4)

julia> floatmax(Float32)
3.4028235f38

julia> floatmax()
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf
```
```
floatmin(T = Float64)
```

Return the smallest positive normal number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmin(Float16)
Float16(6.104e-5)

julia> floatmin(Float32)
1.1754944f-38

julia> floatmin()
2.2250738585072014e-308
```
```
floor([T,] x)
floor(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
floor(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`floor(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is less than or equal to `x`.

`floor(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
floor(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` down to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> floor(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
30 minutes

julia> floor(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
1 day
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.

```
floor(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` less than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> floor(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> floor(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-06T00:00:00
```
```
flush(stream)
```

Commit all currently buffered writes to the given stream.
```
fma(x, y, z)
```

Computes `x*y+z` without rounding the intermediate result `x*y`. On some systems this is significantly more expensive than `x*y+z`. `fma` is used to improve accuracy in certain algorithms. See [`muladd`](@ref).
```
foldl(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

See also [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`foldr`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldl(=>, 1:4)
((1 => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> foldl(=>, 1:4; init=0)
(((0 => 1) => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> accumulate(=>, (1,2,3,4))
(1, 1 => 2, (1 => 2) => 3, ((1 => 2) => 3) => 4)
```
```
foldr(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldr(=>, 1:4)
1 => (2 => (3 => 4))

julia> foldr(=>, 1:4; init=0)
1 => (2 => (3 => (4 => 0)))
```
```
foreach(f, c...) -> Nothing
```

Call function `f` on each element of iterable `c`. For multiple iterable arguments, `f` is called elementwise, and iteration stops when any iterator is finished.

`foreach` should be used instead of [`map`](@ref) when the results of `f` are not needed, for example in `foreach(println, array)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri = 1:3:7; res = Int[];

julia> foreach(x -> push!(res, x^2), tri)

julia> res
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
 16
 49

julia> foreach((x, y) -> println(x, " with ", y), tri, 'a':'z')
1 with a
4 with b
7 with c
```
```
frexp(val)
```

Return `(x,exp)` such that `x` has a magnitude in the interval $[1/2, 1)$ or 0, and `val` is equal to $x \times 2^{exp}$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> frexp(12.8)
(0.8, 4)
```
```
fullname(m::Module)
```

Get the fully-qualified name of a module as a tuple of symbols. For example,

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fullname(Base.Iterators)
(:Base, :Iterators)

julia> fullname(Main)
(:Main,)
```
```
functionloc(m::Method)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a `Method` definition.

```
functionloc(f::Function, types)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a generic `Function` definition.
```
gcd(x, y...)
```

Greatest common (positive) divisor (or zero if all arguments are zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcd(6, 9)
3

julia> gcd(6, -9)
3

julia> gcd(6, 0)
6

julia> gcd(0, 0)
0

julia> gcd(1//3, 2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, -2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, 2)
1//3

julia> gcd(0, 0, 10, 15)
5
```
```
gcdx(a, b)
```

Computes the greatest common (positive) divisor of `a` and `b` and their Bézout coefficients, i.e. the integer coefficients `u` and `v` that satisfy $ua+vb = d = gcd(a, b)$. $gcdx(a, b)$ returns $(d, u, v)$.

The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcdx(12, 42)
(6, -3, 1)

julia> gcdx(240, 46)
(2, -9, 47)
```

!!! note
    Bézout coefficients are *not* uniquely defined. `gcdx` returns the minimal Bézout coefficients that are computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. (Ref: D. Knuth, TAoCP, 2/e, p. 325, Algorithm X.) For signed integers, these coefficients `u` and `v` are minimal in the sense that $|u| < |y/d|$ and $|v| < |x/d|$. Furthermore, the signs of `u` and `v` are chosen so that `d` is positive. For unsigned integers, the coefficients `u` and `v` might be near their `typemax`, and the identity then holds only via the unsigned integers' modulo arithmetic.

```
gensym([tag])
```

Generates a symbol which will not conflict with other variable names.
```
get(collection, key, default)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or the given default value if no mapping for the key is present.

julia> get(d, "c", 3)
3
```

```
get(f::Function, collection, key)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or if no mapping for the key is present, return `f()`.  Use [`get!`](@ref) to also store the default value in the dictionary.

This is intended to be called using `do` block syntax

```julia
get(dict, key) do
    # default value calculated here
    time()
end
```
```
get!(collection, key, default)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or if no mapping for the key is present, store `key => default`, and return `default`.

# Examples

  "a" => 1
  "d" => 4
```

```
get!(f::Function, collection, key)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or if no mapping for the key is present, store `key => f()`, and return `f()`.

This is intended to be called using `do` block syntax.

# Examples

julia> function get_square!(d, i)
           get!(d, i) do
               i^2

```
```
get_zero_subnormals() -> Bool
```

Return `false` if operations on subnormal floating-point values ("denormals") obey rules for IEEE arithmetic, and `true` if they might be converted to zeros.

!!! warning
    This function only affects the current thread.

```
gethostname() -> AbstractString
```

Get the local machine's host name.
```
getindex(type[, elements...])
```

Construct a 1-d array of the specified type. This is usually called with the syntax `Type[]`. Element values can be specified using `Type[a,b,c,...]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8[1, 2, 3]
3-element Vector{Int8}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> getindex(Int8, 1, 2, 3)
3-element Vector{Int8}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
getindex(collection, key...)
```

Retrieve the value(s) stored at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...]` is converted by the compiler to `getindex(a, i, j, ...)`.

See also [`get`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> getindex(A, "a")
1
```

```
getindex(A, inds...)
```

Return a subset of array `A` as specified by `inds`, where each `ind` may be, for example, an `Int`, an [`AbstractRange`](@ref), or a [`Vector`](@ref). See the manual section on [array indexing](@ref man-array-indexing) for details.

```
getindex(tree::GitTree, target::AbstractString) -> GitObject
```

Look up `target` path in the `tree`, returning a [`GitObject`](@ref) (a [`GitBlob`](@ref) in the case of a file, or another [`GitTree`](@ref) if looking up a directory).

# Examples

```julia
tree = LibGit2.GitTree(repo, "HEAD^{tree}")
readme = tree["README.md"]
subtree = tree["test"]
runtests = subtree["runtests.jl"]
```
```
getkey(collection, key, default)
```

Return the key matching argument `key` if one exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`.

# Examples

Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> getkey(D, 'a', 1)

```

Get Julia's process ID.
```
getproperty(value, name::Symbol)
getproperty(value, name::Symbol, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyType
           x
       end

julia> function Base.getproperty(obj::MyType, sym::Symbol)
           if sym === :special

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions of the group owning the file.
```
hardlink(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString)
```

Creates a hard link to an existing source file `src` with the name `dst`. The destination, `dst`, must not exist.

julia> hasfield(Foo, :x)
false
```
```
hash(x[, h::UInt]) -> UInt
```

Compute an integer hash code such that `isequal(x,y)` implies `hash(x)==hash(y)`. The optional second argument `h` is a hash code to be mixed with the result.

New types should implement the 2-argument form, typically by calling the 2-argument `hash` method recursively in order to mix hashes of the contents with each other (and with `h`). Typically, any type that implements `hash` should also implement its own [`==`](@ref) (hence [`isequal`](@ref)) to guarantee the property mentioned above. Types supporting subtraction (operator `-`) should also implement [`widen`](@ref), which is required to hash values inside heterogeneous arrays.

See also: [`objectid`](@ref), [`Dict`](@ref), [`Set`](@ref).
```
haskey(collection, key) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection has a mapping for a given `key`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> haskey(D, 'a')
true

julia> haskey(D, 'c')
false
```
```
hasmethod(f, t::Type{<:Tuple}[, kwnames]; world=get_world_counter()) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching the given `Tuple` of argument types with the upper bound of world age given by `world`.

If a tuple of keyword argument names `kwnames` is provided, this also checks whether the method of `f` matching `t` has the given keyword argument names. If the matching method accepts a variable number of keyword arguments, e.g. with `kwargs...`, any names given in `kwnames` are considered valid. Otherwise the provided names must be a subset of the method's keyword arguments.

See also [`applicable`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Providing keyword argument names requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> hasmethod(length, Tuple{Array})
true

julia> f(; oranges=0) = oranges;

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:oranges,))
true

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:apples, :bananas))

```
hex2bytes(itr)
```

Given an iterable `itr` of ASCII codes for a sequence of hexadecimal digits, returns a `Vector{UInt8}` of bytes  corresponding to the binary representation: each successive pair of hexadecimal digits in `itr` gives the value of one byte in the return vector.

The length of `itr` must be even, and the returned array has half of the length of `itr`. See also [`hex2bytes!`](@ref) for an in-place version, and [`bytes2hex`](@ref) for the inverse.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `hex2bytes` with iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `hex2bytes`.


# Examples

julia> hex2bytes(a)
3-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0xab
 0xef
```
```
hex2bytes!(dest::AbstractVector{UInt8}, itr)
```

Convert an iterable `itr` of bytes representing a hexadecimal string to its binary representation, similar to [`hex2bytes`](@ref) except that the output is written in-place to `dest`. The length of `dest` must be half the length of `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling hex2bytes! with iterators producing UInt8 requires version 1.7. In earlier versions, you can collect the iterable before calling instead.

```
homedir() -> String
```

Return the current user's home directory.

!!! note
    `homedir` determines the home directory via `libuv`'s `uv_os_homedir`. For details (for example on how to specify the home directory via environment variables), see the [`uv_os_homedir` documentation](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/misc.html#c.uv_os_homedir).

```
htol(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Little-endian.
```
hton(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Network byte order (big-endian).
```
hvcat(rows::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, values...)
```

Horizontal and vertical concatenation in one call. This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument specifies the number of arguments to concatenate in each block row.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c; d e f]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> hvcat((3,3), a,b,c,d,e,f)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> [a b; c d; e f]
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6

julia> hvcat((2,2,2), a,b,c,d,e,f)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6
```

If the first argument is a single integer `n`, then all block rows are assumed to have `n` block columns.
```
hvncat(dim::Int, row_first, values...)
hvncat(dims::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, row_first, values...)
hvncat(shape::Tuple{Vararg{Tuple}}, row_first, values...)
```

Horizontal, vertical, and n-dimensional concatenation of many `values` in one call.

This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument either specifies the shape of the concatenation, similar to `hvcat`, as a tuple of tuples, or the dimensions that specify the key number of elements along each axis, and is used to determine the output dimensions. The `dims` form is more performant, and is used by default when the concatenation operation has the same number of elements along each axis (e.g., [a b; c d;;; e f ; g h]). The `shape` form is used when the number of elements along each axis is unbalanced (e.g., [a b ; c]). Unbalanced syntax needs additional validation overhead. The `dim` form is an optimization for concatenation along just one dimension. `row_first` indicates how `values` are ordered. The meaning of the first and second elements of `shape` are also swapped based on `row_first`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c;;; d e f]

hypot(x, y)
```

Compute the hypotenuse $\sqrt{|x|^2+|y|^2}$ avoiding overflow and underflow.

This code is an implementation of the algorithm described in: An Improved Algorithm for `hypot(a,b)` by Carlos F. Borges The article is available online at ArXiv at the link   https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09481

```
hypot(x...)
```

Compute the hypotenuse $\sqrt{\sum |x_i|^2}$ avoiding overflow and underflow.

See also `norm` in the [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg) standard library.

# Examples

julia> a = Int64(10)^10;

julia> hypot(a, a)

```
identity(x)
```

The identity function. Returns its argument.

See also: [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), and [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg)'s `I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> identity("Well, what did you expect?")
"Well, what did you expect?"
```
```
ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)
```

Return `x` if `condition` is `true`, otherwise return `y`. This differs from `?` or `if` in that it is an ordinary function, so all the arguments are evaluated first. In some cases, using `ifelse` instead of an `if` statement can eliminate the branch in generated code and provide higher performance in tight loops.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ifelse(1 > 2, 1, 2)
2
```
```
ignorestatus(command)
```

Mark a command object so that running it will not throw an error if the result code is non-zero.
```
imag(z)
```

Return the imaginary part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`conj`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag(1 + 3im)
3
```

```
imag(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the imaginary part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `imag.(A)`, except that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 2
 4

julia> imag(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
-1
```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

julia> 4 in a
true

julia> 5 in a
false

julia> missing in [1, 2]
missing

```
include_dependency(path::AbstractString)
```

In a module, declare that the file specified by `path` (relative or absolute) is a dependency for precompilation; that is, the module will need to be recompiled if this file changes.

This is only needed if your module depends on a file that is not used via [`include`](@ref). It has no effect outside of compilation.
```
include_string([mapexpr::Function,] m::Module, code::AbstractString, filename::AbstractString="string")
```

Like [`include`](@ref), except reads code from the given string rather than from a file.

The optional first argument `mapexpr` can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression `expr` in `code`, the `include_string` function actually evaluates `mapexpr(expr)`.  If it is omitted, `mapexpr` defaults to [`identity`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Julia 1.5 is required for passing the `mapexpr` argument.

```
indexin(a, b)
```

Return an array containing the first index in `b` for each value in `a` that is a member of `b`. The output array contains `nothing` wherever `a` is not a member of `b`.

See also: [`sortperm`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'a'];

julia> b = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

julia> indexin(a, b)
6-element Vector{Union{Nothing, Int64}}:

julia> indexin(b, a)
3-element Vector{Union{Nothing, Int64}}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
insert!(a::Vector, index::Integer, item)
```

Insert an `item` into `a` at the given `index`. `index` is the index of `item` in the resulting `a`.

See also: [`push!`](@ref), [`replace`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> insert!(Any[1:6;], 3, "here")
7-element Vector{Any}:
 1
 2
  "here"
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
insorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given sorted collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values of the collection according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order, see [`sort`](@ref) for the keywords.

See also [`in`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> insorted(4, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # single match
true

julia> insorted(5, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # multiple matches
true

julia> insorted(3, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false

julia> insorted(9, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false

julia> insorted(0, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `insorted` was added in Julia 1.6.

```
instances(T::Type)
```

Return a collection of all instances of the given type, if applicable. Mostly used for enumerated types (see `@enum`).

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> @enum Color red blue green

julia> instances(Color)
(red, blue, green)
```
```
intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    As of Julia 1.8 intersect returns a result with the eltype of the type-promoted eltypes of the two inputs


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> intersect([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 3

julia> intersect([1, 4, 4, 5, 6], [6, 4, 6, 7, 8])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 6

julia> intersect(1:16, 7:99)
7:16

julia> (0, 0.0) ∩ (-0.0, 0)
1-element Vector{Real}:
 0

julia> intersect(Set([1, 2]), BitSet([2, 3]), 1.0:10.0)
Set{Float64} with 1 element:
  2.0
```
```
intersect!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Intersect all passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.
```
inv(x)
```

Return the multiplicative inverse of `x`, such that `x*inv(x)` or `inv(x)*x` yields [`one(x)`](@ref) (the multiplicative identity) up to roundoff errors.

If `x` is a number, this is essentially the same as `one(x)/x`, but for some types `inv(x)` may be slightly more efficient.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> inv(2)
0.5

julia> inv(1 + 2im)
0.2 - 0.4im

julia> inv(1 + 2im) * (1 + 2im)
1.0 + 0.0im

julia> inv(2//3)
3//2
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `inv(::Missing)` requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
inv(M)
```

Matrix inverse. Computes matrix `N` such that `M * N = I`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Computed by solving the left-division `N = M \ I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> M = [2 5; 1 3]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  5
 1  3

julia> N = inv(M)
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  3.0  -5.0
 -1.0   2.0

julia> M*N == N*M == Matrix(I, 2, 2)
true
```
```
invmod(n, m)
```

Take the inverse of `n` modulo `m`: `y` such that $n y = 1 \pmod m$, and $div(y,m) = 0$. This will throw an error if $m = 0$, or if $gcd(n,m) \neq 1$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> invmod(2, 5)
3

julia> invmod(2, 3)
2

julia> invmod(5, 6)
5
```
No documentation found.

Binding `invokelatest` does not exist.
```
invperm(v)
```

Return the inverse permutation of `v`. If `B = A[v]`, then `A == B[invperm(v)]`.

See also [`sortperm`](@ref), [`invpermute!`](@ref), [`isperm`](@ref), [`permutedims`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> p = (2, 3, 1);

julia> invperm(p)
(3, 1, 2)

julia> v = [2; 4; 3; 1];

julia> invperm(v)

 'c': ASCII/Unicode U+0063 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'd': ASCII/Unicode U+0064 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```
```
invpermute!(v, p)
```

Like [`permute!`](@ref), but the inverse of the given permutation is applied.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> invpermute!(A, perm);

julia> A

```
```
isabspath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path is absolute (begins at the root directory).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabspath("/home")
true

julia> isabspath("home")
false
```
```
isabstracttype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as an abstract type (i.e. using the `abstract` keyword).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabstracttype(AbstractArray)
true

julia> isabstracttype(Vector)
false
```
```
isapprox(x, y; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : √eps, nans::Bool=false[, norm::Function])
```

Inexact equality comparison. Two numbers compare equal if their relative distance *or* their absolute distance is within tolerance bounds: `isapprox` returns `true` if `norm(x-y) <= max(atol, rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y)))`. The default `atol` is zero and the default `rtol` depends on the types of `x` and `y`. The keyword argument `nans` determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).

For real or complex floating-point values, if an `atol > 0` is not specified, `rtol` defaults to the square root of [`eps`](@ref) of the type of `x` or `y`, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significant digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an `atol > 0` is supplied, `rtol` defaults to zero.

The `norm` keyword defaults to `abs` for numeric `(x,y)` and to `LinearAlgebra.norm` for arrays (where an alternative `norm` choice is sometimes useful). When `x` and `y` are arrays, if `norm(x-y)` is not finite (i.e. `±Inf` or `NaN`), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of `x` and `y` are approximately equal component-wise.

The binary operator `≈` is equivalent to `isapprox` with the default arguments, and `x ≉ y` is equivalent to `!isapprox(x,y)`.

Note that `x ≈ 0` (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to `x == 0` since the default `atol` is `0`.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate `atol` (or use `norm(x) ≤ atol`) or rearrange your code (e.g. use `x ≈ y` rather than `x - y ≈ 0`).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero `atol` automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the "units") of your problem: for example, in `x - y ≈ 0`, `atol=1e-9` is an absurdly small tolerance if `x` is the [radius of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius) in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if `x` is the [radius of a Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) in meters.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Passing the `norm` keyword argument when comparing numeric (non-array) arguments requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; atol=0.05)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.34)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.33)
false

julia> 0.1 + 1e-10 ≈ 0.1
true

julia> 1e-10 ≈ 0
false

julia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)
true

julia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0]) # using `norm`
true
```

```
isapprox(x; kwargs...) / ≈(x; kwargs...)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using `≈`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y ≈ x`.

The keyword arguments supported here are the same as those in the 2-argument `isapprox`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This method requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
isascii(c::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character belongs to the ASCII character set, or whether this is true for all elements of a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isascii('a')
true

julia> isascii('α')
false

julia> isascii("abc")
true

julia> isascii("αβγ")
false
```

For example, `isascii` can be used as a predicate function for [`filter`](@ref) or [`replace`](@ref) to remove or replace non-ASCII characters, respectively:

```jldoctest
julia> filter(isascii, "abcdeγfgh") # discard non-ASCII chars
"abcdefgh"

julia> replace("abcdeγfgh", !isascii=>' ') # replace non-ASCII chars with spaces
"abcde fgh"
```
```
isassigned(array, i) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given array has a value associated with index `i`. Return `false` if the index is out of bounds, or has an undefined reference.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 5)
true

julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 3 * 3 + 1)
false

julia> mutable struct Foo end

julia> v = similar(rand(3), Foo)
3-element Vector{Foo}:
 #undef
 #undef
 #undef

julia> isassigned(v, 1)
false
```

```
isassigned(ref::RefValue) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given [`Ref`](@ref) is associated with a value. This is always true for a [`Ref`](@ref) of a bitstype object. Return `false` if the reference is undefined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ref = Ref{Function}()
Base.RefValue{Function}(#undef)

julia> isassigned(ref)
false

julia> ref[] = (foobar(x) = x)
foobar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> isassigned(ref)
true

julia> isassigned(Ref{Int}())
true
```
```
isbits(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is an instance of an [`isbitstype`](@ref) type.
```
isbitstype(T)
```

Return `true` if type `T` is a "plain data" type, meaning it is immutable and contains no references to other values, only `primitive` types and other `isbitstype` types. Typical examples are numeric types such as [`UInt8`](@ref), [`Float64`](@ref), and [`Complex{Float64}`](@ref). This category of types is significant since they are valid as type parameters, may not track [`isdefined`](@ref) / [`isassigned`](@ref) status, and have a defined layout that is compatible with C.

See also [`isbits`](@ref), [`isprimitivetype`](@ref), [`ismutable`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isbitstype(Complex{Float64})
true

julia> isbitstype(Complex)
false
```
```
isblockdev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a block device, `false` otherwise.
```
ischardev(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a character device, `false` otherwise.
```
iscntrl(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is a control character. Control characters are the non-printing characters of the Latin-1 subset of Unicode.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iscntrl('\x01')
true

julia> iscntrl('a')
false
```
```
isconcretetype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a concrete type, meaning it could have direct instances (values `x` such that `typeof(x) === T`).

See also: [`isbits`](@ref), [`isabstracttype`](@ref), [`issingletontype`](@ref).

```

Determine whether the collections `a` and `b` are disjoint. Equivalent to `isempty(a ∩ b)` but more efficient when possible.

See also: [`intersect`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdisjoint([1, 2], [2, 3, 4])
false

julia> isdisjoint([3, 1], [2, 4])

```
```
isdispatchtuple(T)
```

```
isempty(collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isempty([])
true

julia> isempty([1 2 3])
false
```

```
isempty(condition)
```

Return `true` if no tasks are waiting on the condition, `false` otherwise.
```
isequal(x, y)
```

Similar to [`==`](@ref), except for the treatment of floating point numbers and of missing values. `isequal` treats all floating-point `NaN` values as equal to each other, treats `-0.0` as unequal to `0.0`, and [`missing`](@ref) as equal to `missing`. Always returns a `Bool` value.

`isequal` is an equivalence relation - it is reflexive (`===` implies `isequal`), symmetric (`isequal(a, b)` implies `isequal(b, a)`) and transitive (`isequal(a, b)` and `isequal(b, c)` implies `isequal(a, c)`).

# Implementation

The default implementation of `isequal` calls `==`, so a type that does not involve floating-point values generally only needs to define `==`.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that types for which a custom `==` or `isequal` method exists must implement a corresponding [`hash`](@ref) method (and vice versa). Collections typically implement `isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

Furthermore, `isequal` is linked with [`isless`](@ref), and they work together to define a fixed total ordering, where exactly one of `isequal(x, y)`, `isless(x, y)`, or `isless(y, x)` must be `true` (and the other two `false`).

Scalar types generally do not need to implement `isequal` separate from `==`, unless they represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient implementation than that provided as a generic fallback (based on `isnan`, `signbit`, and `==`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isequal([1., NaN], [1., NaN])
true

julia> [1., NaN] == [1., NaN]
false

julia> 0.0 == -0.0
true

julia> isequal(0.0, -0.0)
false

julia> missing == missing
missing

julia> isequal(missing, missing)
true
```

```
isequal(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`isequal`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> isequal(y, x)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(isequal)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
```
iseven(x::Number) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `x` is an even integer (that is, an integer divisible by 2), and `false` otherwise.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Non-`Integer` arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iseven(9)
false

julia> iseven(10)

```
```
isfifo(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a FIFO, `false` otherwise.
```
isfile(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a regular file, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfile(homedir())
false

julia> f = open("test_file.txt", "w");

julia> isfile(f)
true

julia> close(f); rm("test_file.txt")
```

See also [`isdir`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isfinite(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is finite.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfinite(5)
true

julia> isfinite(NaN32)
false
```
```
isimmutable(v) -> Bool
```

!!! warning
    Consider using `!ismutable(v)` instead, as `isimmutable(v)` will be replaced by `!ismutable(v)` in a future release. (Since Julia 1.5)


Return `true` iff value `v` is immutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isimmutable(1)
true

julia> isimmutable([1,2])
false
```
```
isinf(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is infinite.

See also: [`Inf`](@ref), [`iszero`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).
```
isinteger(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` is numerically equal to some integer.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isinteger(4.0)
true
```
```
isinteractive() -> Bool
```

Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.
```
isless(t1::Tuple, t2::Tuple)
```

Returns true when t1 is less than t2 in lexicographic order.

```
isless(x, y)
```

Test whether `x` is less than `y`, according to a fixed total order (defined together with [`isequal`](@ref)). `isless` is not defined on all pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, if it is defined, it is expected to satisfy the following:

  * If `isless(x, y)` is defined, then so is `isless(y, x)` and `isequal(x, y)`, and exactly one of those three yields `true`.
  * The relation defined by `isless` is transitive, i.e., `isless(x, y) && isless(y, z)` implies `isless(x, z)`.

Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`, are ordered after regular values. [`missing`](@ref) values are ordered last.

This is the default comparison used by [`sort`](@ref).

# Implementation

Non-numeric types with a total order should implement this function. Numeric types only need to implement it if they have special values such as `NaN`. Types with a partial order should implement [`<`](@ref). See the documentation on [Alternate orderings](@ref) for how to define alternate ordering methods that can be used in sorting and related functions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless(1, 3)
true

julia> isless("Red", "Blue")
false
```

```
isless(A::AbstractVector, B::AbstractVector)
```

Returns true when `A` is less than `B` in lexicographic order.

```
isless(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether string `a` comes before string `b` in alphabetical order (technically, in lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless("a", "b")
true

julia> isless("β", "α")
false

julia> isless("a", "a")
false
```
```
isletter(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool

Return `true` if `path` is a mount point, `false` otherwise.
```
ismutable(v) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if and only if value `v` is mutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

isnumeric(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is numeric. A character is classified as numeric if it belongs to the Unicode general category Number, i.e. a character whose category code begins with 'N'.

Note that this broad category includes characters such as ¾ and ௰. Use [`isdigit`](@ref) to check whether a character a decimal digit between 0 and 9.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Non-`Integer` arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isodd(9)
true

julia> isodd(10)
false
```
```
isone(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == one(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether `x` is an identity matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isone(1.0)
true

julia> isone([1 0; 0 2])
false

julia> isone([1 0; 0 true])
true
```
```
isopen(object) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an object - such as a stream or timer – is not yet closed. Once an object is closed, it will never produce a new event. However, since a closed stream may still have data to read in its buffer, use [`eof`](@ref) to check for the ability to read data. Use the `FileWatching` package to be notified when a stream might be writable or readable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("my_file.txt", "w+");

julia> isopen(io)
true

julia> close(io)

julia> isopen(io)
false
```
```
ispath(path) -> Bool

Return `true` if a valid filesystem entity exists at `path`, otherwise returns `false`. This is the generalization of [`isfile`](@ref), [`isdir`](@ref) etc.
```
isperm(v) -> Bool
```

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isperm([1; 2])
true

false
```
```
ispow2(n::Number) -> Bool
```

```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as a primitive type (i.e. using the `primitive` keyword).
```
isprint(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character is printable, including spaces, but not a control character.

# Examples

false

julia> isprint('A')
true
```
```
ispunct(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Tests whether a character belongs to the Unicode general category Punctuation, i.e. a character whose category code begins with 'P'.

           isreadable(io)
       end
true

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isreadonly(io) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a stream is read-only.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> isreadonly(io)
true

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> isreadonly(io)
false
```
```
isready(c::Channel)
```

Determine whether a [`Channel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Returns immediately, does not block.

For unbuffered channels returns `true` if there are tasks waiting on a [`put!`](@ref).

```
isready(rr::Future)
```

Determine whether a [`Future`](@ref) has a value stored to it.

If the argument `Future` is owned by a different node, this call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for `rr` in a separate task instead or to use a local [`Channel`](@ref) as a proxy:

```julia
p = 1
f = Future(p)
errormonitor(@async put!(f, remotecall_fetch(long_computation, p)))
isready(f)  # will not block
```

```
isready(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Determine whether a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Note that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may no longer be true. However, it can be safely used on a [`Future`](@ref) since they are assigned only once.
```
isreal(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` or all its elements are numerically equal to some real number including infinities and NaNs. `isreal(x)` is true if `isequal(x, real(x))` is true.

true

julia> isreal([4.; complex(0,1)])
false
```
```
issetequal(a, b) -> Bool

Return `true` if `path` is a socket, `false` otherwise.
```
issorted(v, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Test whether a vector is in sorted order. The `lt`, `by` and `rev` keywords modify what order is considered to be sorted just as they do for [`sort`](@ref).

true

julia> issorted([(1, "b"), (2, "a")], by = x -> x[1])

Determine whether type `T` was declared as a struct type (i.e. using the `struct` or `mutable struct` keyword).
```
issubnormal(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a floating point number is subnormal.
```
issubset(a, b) -> Bool
⊆(a, b) -> Bool
⊇(b, a) -> Bool
```

Determine whether every element of `a` is also in `b`, using [`in`](@ref).

See also [`⊊`](@ref), [`⊈`](@ref), [`∩`](@ref intersect), [`∪`](@ref union), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> issubset([1, 2], [1, 2, 3])
true

julia> [1, 2, 3] ⊆ [1, 2]

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
istaskstarted(t::Task) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a task has started executing.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a3() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a3);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false
```
```
istextmime(m::MIME)
```

Determine whether a MIME type is text data. MIME types are assumed to be binary data except for a set of types known to be text data (possibly Unicode).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> istextmime(MIME("text/plain"))
true

julia> istextmime(MIME("image/png"))
false
```
```
isunordered(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is a value that is not orderable according to [`<`](@ref), such as `NaN` or `missing`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
isuppercase(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool

```
isvalid(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Bool
```

Predicate indicating whether the given index is the start of the encoding of a character in `s` or not. If `isvalid(s, i)` is true then `s[i]` will return the character whose encoding starts at that index, if it's false, then `s[i]` will raise an invalid index error or a bounds error depending on if `i` is in bounds. In order for `isvalid(s, i)` to be an O(1) function, the encoding of `s` must be [self-synchronizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code). This is a basic assumption of Julia's generic string support.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`iterate`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref), [`length`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγdef";

julia> isvalid(str, 1)
true

julia> str[1]
'α': Unicode U+03B1 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> isvalid(str, 2)

ERROR: StringIndexError: invalid index [2], valid nearby indices [1]=>'α', [3]=>'β'
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
isvalid(value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for its type, which currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String` or `SubString{String}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

false

julia> isvalid(SubString(String(UInt8[0xfe,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80]),1,2))
false

julia> isvalid(Char(0xd799))
true
```

```
isvalid(T, value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for that type. Types currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String`. Values for `AbstractChar` can be of type `AbstractChar` or [`UInt32`](@ref). Values for `String` can be of that type, `SubString{String}`, `Vector{UInt8}`, or a contiguous subarray thereof.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd800)
false

julia> isvalid(String, SubString("thisisvalid",1,5))
true

julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd799)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Support for subarray values was added in Julia 1.6.

```
iswritable(io) -> Bool
```

Return `false` if the specified IO object is not writable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           print(io, "Hello world!");
           iswritable(io)
       end
true

julia> open("myfile.txt", "r") do io
           iswritable(io)
       end
false

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isxdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character is a valid hexadecimal digit. Note that this does not include `x` (as in the standard `0x` prefix).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isxdigit('a')
true

julia> isxdigit('x')
false
```
```
iszero(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == zero(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether all of the elements of `x` are zero.

See also: [`isone`](@ref), [`isinteger`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iszero(0.0)
true

julia> iszero([1, 9, 0])
false

julia> iszero([false, 0, 0])
true
```
```
iterate(iter [, state]) -> Union{Nothing, Tuple{Any, Any}}
```

Advance the iterator to obtain the next element. If no elements remain, `nothing` should be returned. Otherwise, a 2-tuple of the next element and the new iteration state should be returned.

```
iterate(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{Tuple{<:AbstractChar, Int}, Nothing}
```

Return a tuple of the character in `s` at index `i` with the index of the start of the following character in `s`. This is the key method that allows strings to be iterated, yielding a sequences of characters. If `i` is out of bounds in `s` then a bounds error is raised. The `iterate` function, as part of the iteration protocol may assume that `i` is the start of a character in `s`.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
join([io::IO,] iterator [, delim [, last]])
```

Join any `iterator` into a single string, inserting the given delimiter (if any) between adjacent items.  If `last` is given, it will be used instead of `delim` between the last two items.  Each item of `iterator` is converted to a string via `print(io::IOBuffer, x)`. If `io` is given, the result is written to `io` rather than returned as a `String`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> join(["apples", "bananas", "pineapples"], ", ", " and ")
"apples, bananas and pineapples"

julia> join([1,2,3,4,5])
"12345"
```
```
joinpath(parts::AbstractString...) -> String
joinpath(parts::Vector{AbstractString}) -> String
joinpath(parts::Tuple{AbstractString}) -> String
```

Join path components into a full path. If some argument is an absolute path or (on Windows) has a drive specification that doesn't match the drive computed for the join of the preceding paths, then prior components are dropped.

Note on Windows since there is a current directory for each drive, `joinpath("c:", "foo")` represents a path relative to the current directory on drive "c:" so this is equal to "c:foo", not "c:\foo". Furthermore, `joinpath` treats this as a non-absolute path and ignores the drive letter casing, hence `joinpath("C:\A","c:b") = "C:\A\b"`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath("/home/myuser", "example.jl")
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath(["/home/myuser", "example.jl"])
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```
```
keepat!(a::Vector, inds)
keepat!(a::BitVector, inds)
```

Remove the items at all the indices which are not given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Items which are kept are shifted to fill the resulting gaps.

`inds` must be an iterator of sorted and unique integer indices. See also [`deleteat!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keepat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 2
```

```
keepat!(a::Vector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
keepat!(a::BitVector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
```

The in-place version of logical indexing `a = a[m]`. That is, `keepat!(a, m)` on vectors of equal length `a` and `m` will remove all elements from `a` for which `m` at the corresponding index is `false`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [:a, :b, :c];

julia> keepat!(a, [true, false, true])
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c

julia> a
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c
```
```
keys(a::AbstractArray)
```

Return an efficient array describing all valid indices for `a` arranged in the shape of `a` itself.

They keys of 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) are integers, whereas all other N-dimensional arrays use [`CartesianIndex`](@ref) to describe their locations.  Often the special array types [`LinearIndices`](@ref) and [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) are used to efficiently represent these arrays of integers and `CartesianIndex`es, respectively.

Note that the `keys` of an array might not be the most efficient index type; for maximum performance use  [`eachindex`](@ref) instead.

```
keys(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values (e.g. arrays and dictionaries), return an iterator over the keys.

```
keys(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all keys in a dictionary. `collect(keys(a))` returns an array of keys. When the keys are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(keys(D))
2-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

```
keys(m::RegexMatch) -> Vector
```

Return a vector of keys for all capture groups of the underlying regex. A key is included even if the capture group fails to match. That is, `idx` will be in the return value even if `m[idx] == nothing`.

Unnamed capture groups will have integer keys corresponding to their index. Named capture groups will have string keys.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method was added in Julia 1.6


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keys(match(r"(?<hour>\d+):(?<minute>\d+)(am|pm)?", "11:30"))
3-element Vector{Any}:
  "hour"
  "minute"
 3
```
```
keytype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
keytype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the key type of an array. This is equal to the `eltype` of the result of `keys(...)`, and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype([1, 2, 3]) == Int
true

julia> keytype([1 2; 3 4])
CartesianIndex{2}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
keytype(type)
```

Get the key type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
Int32
```
```
kill(p::Process, signum=Base.SIGTERM)
```

Send a signal to a process. The default is to terminate the process. Returns successfully if the process has already exited, but throws an error if killing the process failed for other reasons (e.g. insufficient permissions).

```
kill(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)
```

Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, by [`rmprocs`](@ref). It should cause the remote worker specified by `pid` to exit. `kill(manager::ClusterManager.....)` executes a remote `exit()` on `pid`.
```
kron(A, B)
```

Kronecker tensor product of two vectors or two matrices.

For real vectors `v` and `w`, the Kronecker product is related to the outer product by `kron(v,w) == vec(w * transpose(v))` or `w * transpose(v) == reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))`. Note how the ordering of `v` and `w` differs on the left and right of these expressions (due to column-major storage). For complex vectors, the outer product `w * v'` also differs by conjugation of `v`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> B = [im 1; 1 -im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im
 1+0im  0-1im

julia> kron(A, B)
4×4 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im  0+2im  2+0im
 1+0im  0-1im  2+0im  0-2im
 0+3im  3+0im  0+4im  4+0im
 3+0im  0-3im  4+0im  0-4im

julia> v = [1, 2]; w = [3, 4, 5];

julia> w*transpose(v)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10

julia> reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10
```
```
kron!(C, A, B)
```

`kron!` is the in-place version of [`kron`](@ref). Computes `kron(A, B)` and stores the result in `C` overwriting the existing value of `C`.

!!! tip
    Bounds checking can be disabled by [`@inbounds`](@ref), but you need to take care of the shape of `C`, `A`, `B` yourself.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
last(coll)
```

Get the last element of an ordered collection, if it can be computed in O(1) time. This is accomplished by calling [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last index. Return the end point of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) even if it is empty.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`endswith`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(1:2:10)
9

julia> last([1; 2; 3; 4])
4
```

```
last(itr, n::Integer)
```

Get the last `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(["foo", "bar", "qux"], 2)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "bar"
 "qux"

julia> last(1:6, 10)
1:6

julia> last(Float64[], 1)
Float64[]
```

```
last(s::AbstractString, n::Integer)
```

Get a string consisting of the last `n` characters of `s`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 0)
""

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 1)
"0"

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 3)
"²>0"
```
```
lastindex(collection) -> Integer
lastindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the last index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the last index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[end]` and `A[end, end]` lower to `A[lastindex(A)]` and `A[lastindex(A, 1), lastindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`axes`](@ref), [`firstindex`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lastindex([1,2,4])
3

julia> lastindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
4
```
```
lcm(x, y...)
```

Least common (positive) multiple (or zero if any argument is zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lcm(2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(-2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(0, 3)
0

julia> lcm(0, 0)
0

julia> lcm(1//3, 2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, -2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, 2)
2//1

julia> lcm(1, 3, 5, 7)
105
```
```
ldexp(x, n)
```

Compute $x \times 2^n$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ldexp(5., 2)
20.0
```
```
leading_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_ones(UInt32(2 ^ 32 - 2))
31
```
```
leading_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_zeros(Int32(1))
31
```
```
length(collection) -> Integer
```

Return the number of elements in the collection.

Use [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last valid index of an indexable collection.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length(1:5)
5

julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the number of elements in the array, defaults to `prod(size(A))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(s::AbstractString) -> Int
length(s::AbstractString, i::Integer, j::Integer) -> Int
```

Return the number of characters in string `s` from indices `i` through `j`.

This is computed as the number of code unit indices from `i` to `j` which are valid character indices. With only a single string argument, this computes the number of characters in the entire string. With `i` and `j` arguments it computes the number of indices between `i` and `j` inclusive that are valid indices in the string `s`. In addition to in-bounds values, `i` may take the out-of-bounds value `ncodeunits(s) + 1` and `j` may take the out-of-bounds value `0`.

!!! note
    The time complexity of this operation is linear in general. That is, it will take the time proportional to the number of bytes or characters in the string because it counts the value on the fly. This is in contrast to the method for arrays, which is a constant-time operation.


See also [`isvalid`](@ref), [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length("jμΛIα")
5
```
```
lock(lock)
```

Acquire the `lock` when it becomes available. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

Each `lock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).

```
lock(f::Function, lock)
```

Acquire the `lock`, execute `f` with the `lock` held, and release the `lock` when `f` returns. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

When this function returns, the `lock` has been released, so the caller should not attempt to `unlock` it.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a [`Channel`](@ref) as the second argument requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
log(b,x)
```

Compute the base `b` logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(4,8)
1.5

julia> log(4,2)
0.5

julia> log(-2, 3)
ERROR: DomainError with -2.0:

[...]
```

!!! note
    If `b` is a power of 2 or 10, [`log2`](@ref) or [`log10`](@ref) should be used, as these will typically be faster and more accurate. For example,

    ```jldoctest
    julia> log(100,1000000)
    2.9999999999999996

    julia> log10(1000000)/2
    3.0
    ```


```
log(x)
```

Compute the natural logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments to obtain complex results.

See also [`log1p`], [`log2`], [`log10`].

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(2)

```

```
log(A::StridedMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of `A`, i.e. the unique matrix $X$ such that $e^X = A$ and $-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi$ for all the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $X$. If `A` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, if `A` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [^AH12] and [^AHR13]). If `A` is real with no negative eigenvalues, then the real Schur form is computed. Otherwise, the complex Schur form is computed. Then the upper (quasi-)triangular algorithm in [^AHR13] is used on the upper (quasi-)triangular factor.

```
lowercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to lowercase.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`lowercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercase("STRINGS AND THINGS")
"strings and things"
```
```
lowercasefirst(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to lowercase.

See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercasefirst("Julia")
"julia"
```
```
lpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the left with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lpad("March", 10)
"     March"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
lstat(file)
```

Like [`stat`](@ref), but for symbolic links gets the info for the link itself rather than the file it refers to. This function must be called on a file path rather than a file object or a file descriptor.
```
lstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
lstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = lpad("March", 20)
"               March"

julia> lstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
ltoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Little-endian to that used by the Host.
```
macroexpand(m::Module, x; recursive=true)
```

Take the expression `x` and return an equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded) for executing in module `m`. The `recursive` keyword controls whether deeper levels of nested macros are also expanded. This is demonstrated in the example below:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m1()
               42
           end
           macro m2()
               :(@m1())
           end
       end
M

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=true)
42

julia> macroexpand(M, :(@m2()), recursive=false)
:(#= REPL[16]:6 =# M.@m1)
```
```
map(f, c...) -> collection
```

Transform collection `c` by applying `f` to each element. For multiple collection arguments, apply `f` elementwise, and stop when when any of them is exhausted.

See also [`map!`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`mapreduce`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`Iterators.map`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> map(x -> x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 4
 6

julia> map(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 400, 5000])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 11
 22
 33
```

```
map(f, A::AbstractArray...) -> N-array
```

When acting on multi-dimensional arrays of the same [`ndims`](@ref), they must all have the same [`axes`](@ref), and the answer will too.

See also [`broadcast`](@ref), which allows mismatched sizes.

# Examples

```
julia> map(//, [1 2; 3 4], [4 3; 2 1])
2×2 Matrix{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//4  2//3
 3//2  4//1

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], zeros(2,1))
ERROR: DimensionMismatch

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], [1,10,100,1000], zeros(3,1))  # iterates until 3rd is exhausted
3-element Vector{Float64}:
   2.0
  13.0
 102.0
```
```
map!(function, destination, collection...)
```

Like [`map`](@ref), but stores the result in `destination` rather than a new collection. `destination` must be at least as large as the smallest collection.

See also: [`map`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`copyto!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = zeros(3);

julia> map!(x -> x * 2, a, [1, 2, 3]);

julia> a
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 2.0

julia> map!(+, zeros(Int, 5), 100:999, 1:3)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 101
 103
 105
   0
   0
```

```
map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))
```

Modifies `dict` by transforming each value from `val` to `f(val)`. Note that the type of `dict` cannot be changed: if `f(val)` is not an instance of the value type of `dict` then it will be converted to the value type if possible and otherwise raise an error.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))` requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2)
Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries:
  :a => 1
  :b => 2

julia> map!(v -> v-1, values(d))
ValueIterator for a Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  0
  1
```
```
mapfoldl(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity, as in [`foldl`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapfoldr(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity, as in [`foldr`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapreduce(f, op, itrs...; [init])
```

Apply function `f` to each element(s) in `itrs`, and then reduce the result using the binary function `op`. If provided, `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

[`mapreduce`](@ref) is functionally equivalent to calling `reduce(op, map(f, itr); init=init)`, but will in general execute faster since no intermediate collection needs to be created. See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref) and [`map`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mapreduce(x->x^2, +, [1:3;]) # == 1 + 4 + 9
14
```

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent. Additionally, some implementations may reuse the return value of `f` for elements that appear multiple times in `itr`. Use [`mapfoldl`](@ref) or [`mapfoldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity and invocation of `f` for every value.

```
mapreduce(f, op, A::AbstractArray...; dims=:, [init])
```

Evaluates to the same as `reduce(op, map(f, A...); dims=dims, init=init)`, but is generally faster because the intermediate array is avoided.

    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.

```
```
mapslices(f, A; dims)
```

Transform the given dimensions of array `A` using function `f`. `f` is called on each slice of `A` of the form `A[...,:,...,:,...]`. `dims` is an integer vector specifying where the colons go in this expression. The results are concatenated along the remaining dimensions. For example, if `dims` is `[1,2]` and `A` is 4-dimensional, `f` is called on `A[:,:,i,j]` for all `i` and `j`.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref).

```
mark(s::IO)
```

Add a mark at the current position of stream `s`. Return the marked position.

See also [`unmark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
match(r::Regex, s::AbstractString[, idx::Integer[, addopts]])
```

Search for the first match of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return a [`RegexMatch`](@ref) object containing the match, or nothing if the match failed. The matching substring can be retrieved by accessing `m.match` and the captured sequences can be retrieved by accessing `m.captures` The optional `idx` argument specifies an index at which to start the search.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a(.)a"
r"a(.)a"

julia> m = match(rx, "cabac")
RegexMatch("aba", 1="b")

julia> m.captures
1-element Vector{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}}}:
 "b"

julia> m.match
"aba"

julia> match(rx, "cabac", 3) === nothing

```
```
max(x, y, ...)
```

Return the maximum of the arguments (with respect to [`isless`](@ref)). See also the [`maximum`](@ref) function to take the maximum element from a collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> max(2, 5, 1)
5
```
```
maximum(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest result of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

-1

julia> maximum(sin, Real[]; init=-1.0)  # good, since output of sin is >= -1
-1.0
```

```
maximum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest element in a collection.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

```
maximum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`max(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the maximum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `max.(a,b)`.

See also: [`maximum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmax`](@ref), [`argmax`](@ref).

```

```
maximum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

```
```
maxintfloat(T=Float64)
```

The largest consecutive integer-valued floating-point number that is exactly represented in the given floating-point type `T` (which defaults to `Float64`).

That is, `maxintfloat` returns the smallest positive integer-valued floating-point number `n` such that `n+1` is *not* exactly representable in the type `T`.

When an `Integer`-type value is needed, use `Integer(maxintfloat(T))`.

```
maxintfloat(T, S)
```

The largest consecutive integer representable in the given floating-point type `T` that also does not exceed the maximum integer representable by the integer type `S`.  Equivalently, it is the minimum of `maxintfloat(T)` and [`typemax(S)`](@ref).
```
merge(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. If the same key is present in another collection, the value for that key will be the value it has in the last collection listed. See also [`mergewith`](@ref) for custom handling of values with the same key.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict("foo" => 0.0, "bar" => 42.0)
Dict{String, Float64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> b = Dict("baz" => 17, "bar" => 4711)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 4711
  "baz" => 17

julia> merge(a, b)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 4711.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> merge(b, a)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, bs::NamedTuple...)
```

Construct a new named tuple by merging two or more existing ones, in a left-associative manner. Merging proceeds left-to-right, between pairs of named tuples, and so the order of fields present in both the leftmost and rightmost named tuples take the same position as they are found in the leftmost named tuple. However, values are taken from matching fields in the rightmost named tuple that contains that field. Fields present in only the rightmost named tuple of a pair are appended at the end. A fallback is implemented for when only a single named tuple is supplied, with signature `merge(a::NamedTuple)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Merging 3 or more `NamedTuple` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), (b=4, d=5))
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2), (b=3, c=(d=1,)), (c=(d=2,),))
(a = 1, b = 3, c = (d = 2,))
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, iterable)
```

Interpret an iterable of key-value pairs as a named tuple, and perform a merge.

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), [:b=>4, :d=>5])
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```
```
merge!(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. See also [`merge`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d1 = Dict(1 => 2, 3 => 4);

julia> d2 = Dict(1 => 4, 4 => 5);

julia> merge!(d1, d2);

julia> d1
Dict{Int64, Int64} with 3 entries:
  4 => 5
  3 => 4
  1 => 4
```
```
mergewith(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
mergewith(combine)
merge(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `mergewith` requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
```
mergewith!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
mergewith!(combine)
merge!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith!(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith!(combine, args...)`.

```
```
methods(f, [types], [module])
```

Return the method table for `f`.

```
```
minimum(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the smallest result of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `min` (i.e. which is greater than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

```
minimum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`min(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the minimum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `min.(a,b)`.

See also: [`minimum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmin`](@ref), [`argmin`](@ref).

minmax(x, y)
```

Return `(min(x,y), max(x,y))`.

```
mkdir(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Make a new directory with name `path` and permissions `mode`. `mode` defaults to `0o777`, modified by the current file creation mask. This function never creates more than one directory. If the directory already exists, or some intermediate directories do not exist, this function throws an error. See [`mkpath`](@ref) for a function which creates all required intermediate directories. Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> mkdir("testingdir")
"testingdir"

julia> cd("testingdir")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/testingdir"
```
```
mkpath(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Create all intermediate directories in the `path` as required. Directories are created with the permissions `mode` which defaults to `0o777` and is modified by the current file creation mask. Unlike [`mkdir`](@ref), `mkpath` does not error if `path` (or parts of it) already exists. However, an error will be thrown if `path` (or parts of it) points to an existing file. Return `path`.

If `path` includes a filename you will probably want to use `mkpath(dirname(path))` to avoid creating a directory using the filename.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd(mktempdir())

julia> mkpath("my/test/dir") # creates three directories
"my/test/dir"

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "my"

julia> cd("my")

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:

```
```
mktemp(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> (path, io)
```

Return `(path, io)`, where `path` is the path of a new temporary file in `parent` and `io` is an open file object for this path. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary file is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktemp` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


```
mktemp(f::Function, parent=tempdir())
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktemp(parent)`](@ref) and remove the temporary file upon completion.

See also: [`mktempdir`](@ref).
```
mktempdir(parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_", cleanup=true) -> path
```

Create a temporary directory in the `parent` directory with a name constructed from the given prefix and a random suffix, and return its path. Additionally, any trailing `X` characters may be replaced with random characters. If `parent` does not exist, throw an error. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary directory is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.


!!! compat "Julia 1.3"

mod(x::Integer, r::AbstractUnitRange)
```

Find `y` in the range `r` such that $x ≡ y (mod n)$, where `n = length(r)`, i.e. `y = mod(x - first(r), n) + first(r)`.

See also [`mod1`](@ref).

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


```
mod(x, y)
rem(x, y, RoundDown)
```

The reduction of `x` modulo `y`, or equivalently, the remainder of `x` after floored division by `y`, i.e. `x - y*fld(x,y)` if computed without intermediate rounding.

The result will have the same sign as `y`, and magnitude less than `abs(y)` (with some exceptions, see note below).

!!! note
    When used with floating point values, the exact result may not be representable by the type, and so rounding error may occur. In particular, if the exact result is very close to `y`, then it may be rounded to `y`.

```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```
```
mod1(x, y)
```

Modulus after flooring division, returning a value `r` such that `mod(r, y) == mod(x, y)` in the range $(0, y]$ for positive `y` and in the range $[y,0)$ for negative `y`.

With integer arguments and positive `y`, this is equal to `mod(x, 1:y)`, and hence natural for 1-based indexing. By comparison, `mod(x, y) == mod(x, 0:y-1)` is natural for computations with offsets or strides.

See also [`mod`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

```
```
mod2pi(x)
```

Modulus after division by `2π`, returning in the range $[0,2π)$.

This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact `2π`, and is therefore not exactly the same as `mod(x,2π)`, which would compute the modulus of `x` relative to division by the floating-point number `2π`.

!!! note
    Depending on the format of the input value, the closest representable value to 2π may be less than 2π. For example, the expression `mod2pi(2π)` will not return `0`, because the intermediate value of `2*π` is a `Float64` and `2*Float64(π) < 2*big(π)`. See [`rem2pi`](@ref) for more refined control of this behavior.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod2pi(9*pi/4)
0.7853981633974481
```
```
modf(x)
```

Return a tuple `(fpart, ipart)` of the fractional and integral parts of a number. Both parts have the same sign as the argument.

# Examples

julia> modf(3.5)
(0.5, 3.0)

The syntax `@atomic! max(a().b, c)` returns `modifyproperty!(a(), :b, max, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where the first argument must be a `getfield` expression and is modified atomically.

See also [`modifyfield!`](@ref Core.modifyfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
mtime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mtime`.
```
muladd(x, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add: computes `x*y+z`, but allowing the add and multiply to be merged with each other or with surrounding operations for performance. For example, this may be implemented as an [`fma`](@ref) if the hardware supports it efficiently. The result can be different on different machines and can also be different on the same machine due to constant propagation or other optimizations. See [`fma`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> muladd(3, 2, 1)
7

julia> 3 * 2 + 1
7
```

```
muladd(A, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add, `A*y .+ z`, for matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. The result is always the same size as `A*y`, but `z` may be smaller, or a scalar.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    These methods require Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A=[1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]; B=[1.0 1.0; 1.0 1.0]; z=[0, 100];

julia> muladd(A, B, z)

   3.0    3.0
 107.0  107.0
```
```
mv(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false)
```

Move the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`. Return `dst`.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> write("hello.txt", "world");

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
"goodbye.txt"

julia> "hello.txt" in readdir()
false

julia> readline("goodbye.txt")
"world"

julia> write("hello.txt", "world2");

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
ERROR: ArgumentError: 'goodbye.txt' exists. `force=true` is required to remove 'goodbye.txt' before moving.

```
nameof(m::Module) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a `Module` as a [`Symbol`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nameof(Base.Broadcast)
:Broadcast
```

```
nameof(t::DataType) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType` (without its parent module) as a symbol.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct S{T}
           end
       end
Foo

julia> nameof(Foo.S{T} where T)
:S
```

```
nameof(f::Function) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a generic `Function` as a symbol. For anonymous functions, this is a compiler-generated name. For explicitly-declared subtypes of `Function`, it is the name of the function's type.
```
names(x::Module; all::Bool = false, imported::Bool = false)
```

Get an array of the names exported by a `Module`, excluding deprecated names. If `all` is true, then the list also includes non-exported names defined in the module, deprecated names, and compiler-generated names. If `imported` is true, then names explicitly imported from other modules are also included.

As a special case, all names defined in `Main` are considered "exported", since it is not idiomatic to explicitly export names from `Main`.

```
nand(x, y)
⊼(x, y)
```

Bitwise nand (not and) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊼ b` is a synonym for `nand(a,b)`, and `⊼` can be typed by tab-completing `\nand` or `\barwedge` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nand(true, false)
true

julia> nand(true, true)
false

julia> nand(true, missing)
missing

julia> false ⊼ false

ncodeunits(c::Char) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units required to encode a character as UTF-8. This is the number of bytes which will be printed if the character is written to an output stream, or `ncodeunits(string(c))` but computed efficiently.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 consider using `ncodeunits(string(c))`.


```
ncodeunits(s::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units in a string. Indices that are in bounds to access this string must satisfy `1 ≤ i ≤ ncodeunits(s)`. Not all such indices are valid – they may not be the start of a character, but they will return a code unit value when calling `codeunit(s,i)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ncodeunits("The Julia Language")
18

julia> ncodeunits("∫eˣ")
6

julia> ncodeunits('∫'), ncodeunits('e'), ncodeunits('ˣ')
(3, 1, 2)
```

See also [`codeunit`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref), [`sizeof`](@ref), [`length`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref).
```
ndigits(n::Integer; base::Integer=10, pad::Integer=1)
```

Compute the number of digits in integer `n` written in base `base` (`base` must not be in `[-1, 0, 1]`), optionally padded with zeros to a specified size (the result will never be less than `pad`).

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ndigits(12345)
5

julia> ndigits(1022, base=16)
3

julia> string(1022, base=16)
"3fe"

julia> ndigits(123, pad=5)
5

julia> ndigits(-123)
3
```
```
ndims(A::AbstractArray) -> Integer
```

Return the number of dimensions of `A`.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> ndims(A)
3
```
```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `nextfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`prevfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the smallest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `x < y`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.

See also: [`prevfloat`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref).
```
nextind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts after index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the next character; if `i` is not the start of a character, move forward until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `0` return `1`. If `i` is in bounds but greater or equal to `lastindex(str)` return `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `nextind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `nextind` would reach `ncodeunits(str)+1` then each remaining iteration increases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `nextind` can return a value greater than `ncodeunits(str)+1`.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `s` or is equal to `0`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextind("α", 0)
1

julia> nextind("α", 1)
3

julia> nextind("α", 3)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [3]
[...]

julia> nextind("α", 0, 2)
3

julia> nextind("α", 1, 2)
4
```
```
nextpow(a, x)
```

The smallest `a^n` not less than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must be greater than 0.

See also [`prevpow`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextpow(2, 7)
8

julia> nextpow(2, 9)
16

julia> nextpow(5, 20)
25

julia> nextpow(4, 16)
16
```
```
nextprod(factors::Union{Tuple,AbstractVector}, n)
```

Next integer greater than or equal to `n` that can be written as $\prod k_i^{p_i}$ for integers $p_1$, $p_2$, etcetera, for factors $k_i$ in `factors`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextprod((2, 3), 105)
108

julia> 2^2 * 3^3
108
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The method that accepts a tuple requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
nonmissingtype(T::Type)
```

If `T` is a union of types containing `Missing`, return a new type with `Missing` removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nonmissingtype(Union{Int64,Missing})
Int64

julia> nonmissingtype(Any)
Any
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function is exported as of Julia 1.3.

```
nor(x, y)
⊽(x, y)
```

Bitwise nor (not or) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊽ b` is a synonym for `nor(a,b)`, and `⊽` can be typed by tab-completing `\nor` or `\barvee` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nor(true, false)
false

julia> nor(true, true)
false

julia> nor(true, missing)
false

julia> false ⊽ false

```
normpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Normalize a path, removing "." and ".." entries and changing "/" to the canonical path separator for the system.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> normpath("/home/myuser/../example.jl")
"/home/example.jl"

julia> normpath("Documents/Julia") == joinpath("Documents", "Julia")
true
```

```
normpath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to a normalized path by joining them together and removing "." and ".." entries. Equivalent to `normpath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)
```

Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them `val`. If `all` is `true` (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If `error` is `true`, the passed value is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

Return the count of tasks woken up. Return 0 if no tasks are waiting on `condition`.
```
ntoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Network byte order (big-endian) to that used by the Host.
```
ntuple(f::Function, n::Integer)
```

Create a tuple of length `n`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, 4)
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```
ntuple(f, ::Val{N})
```

Create a tuple of length `N`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element. By taking a `Val(N)` argument, it is possible that this version of ntuple may generate more efficient code than the version taking the length as an integer. But `ntuple(f, N)` is preferable to `ntuple(f, Val(N))` in cases where `N` cannot be determined at compile time.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, Val(4))
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```
```
numerator(x)
```

Numerator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> numerator(2//3)
2

julia> numerator(4)
4
```
```
objectid(x) -> UInt
```

Get a hash value for `x` based on object identity. `objectid(x)==objectid(y)` if `x === y`.

See also [`hash`](@ref), [`IdDict`](@ref).
```
occursin(needle::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern,AbstractChar}, haystack::AbstractString)
```

Determine whether the first argument is a substring of the second. If `needle` is a regular expression, checks whether `haystack` contains a match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> occursin("Julia", "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin('a', "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "aba")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "abba")
false
```

See also [`contains`](@ref).

```
occursin(haystack)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument occurs in `haystack`, i.e. a function equivalent to `needle -> occursin(needle, haystack)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(occursin)}`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
oftype(x, y)
```

Convert `y` to the type of `x` (`convert(typeof(x), y)`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 4;

julia> y = 3.;

julia> oftype(x, y)
3

julia> oftype(y, x)
4.0
```
```
one(x)
one(T::type)
```

Return a multiplicative identity for `x`: a value such that `one(x)*x == x*one(x) == x`.  Alternatively `one(T)` can take a type `T`, in which case `one` returns a multiplicative identity for any `x` of type `T`.

If possible, `one(x)` returns a value of the same type as `x`, and `one(T)` returns a value of type `T`.  However, this may not be the case for types representing dimensionful quantities (e.g. time in days), since the multiplicative identity must be dimensionless.  In that case, `one(x)` should return an identity value of the same precision (and shape, for matrices) as `x`.

If you want a quantity that is of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`, even if `x` is dimensionful, use [`oneunit`](@ref) instead.

See also the [`identity`](@ref) function, and `I` in [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg) for the identity matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> one(3.7)
1.0

julia> one(Int)
1

julia> import Dates; one(Dates.Day(1))
1
```
```
ones([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
ones([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all ones with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ones(1,2)
1×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0

julia> ones(ComplexF64, 2, 3)
2×3 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
 1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im
 1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im
```
```
oneunit(x::T)
oneunit(T::Type)
```

Returns `T(one(x))`, where `T` is either the type of the argument or (if a type is passed) the argument.  This differs from [`one`](@ref) for dimensionful quantities: `one` is dimensionless (a multiplicative identity) while `oneunit` is dimensionful (of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> oneunit(3.7)
1.0

julia> import Dates; oneunit(Dates.Day)
1 day
```
```
only(x)
```

Return the one and only element of collection `x`, or throw an [`ArgumentError`](@ref) if the collection has zero or multiple elements.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`last`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.4.

```
open(f::Function, args...; kwargs...)
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of `open(args...; kwargs...)` and close the resulting file descriptor upon completion.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "Hello world!")
       end;

julia> open(f->read(f, String), "myfile.txt")
"Hello world!"

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```

```
open(filename::AbstractString; lock = true, keywords...) -> IOStream
```

Open a file in a mode specified by five boolean keyword arguments:

| Keyword    | Description            | Default                               |
|:---------- |:---------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| `read`     | open for reading       | `!write`                              |
| `write`    | open for writing       | `truncate \| append`                  |
| `create`   | create if non-existent | `!read & write \| truncate \| append` |
| `truncate` | truncate to zero size  | `!read & write`                       |
| `append`   | seek to end            | `false`                               |

The default when no keywords are passed is to open files for reading only. Returns a stream for accessing the opened file.

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(filename::AbstractString, [mode::AbstractString]; lock = true) -> IOStream
```

Alternate syntax for open, where a string-based mode specifier is used instead of the five booleans. The values of `mode` correspond to those from `fopen(3)` or Perl `open`, and are equivalent to setting the following boolean groups:

| Mode | Description                   | Keywords                       |
|:---- |:----------------------------- |:------------------------------ |
| `r`  | read                          | none                           |
| `w`  | write, create, truncate       | `write = true`                 |
| `a`  | write, create, append         | `append = true`                |
| `r+` | read, write                   | `read = true, write = true`    |
| `w+` | read, write, create, truncate | `truncate = true, read = true` |
| `a+` | read, write, create, append   | `append = true, read = true`   |

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "w");

julia> write(io, "Hello world!");

julia> close(io);

julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "r");

julia> read(io, String)
"Hello world!"

julia> write(io, "This file is read only")
ERROR: ArgumentError: write failed, IOStream is not writeable
[...]

julia> close(io)

julia> io = open("myfile.txt", "a");

julia> write(io, "This stream is not read only")
28

julia> close(io)

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(fd::OS_HANDLE) -> IO
```

Take a raw file descriptor wrap it in a Julia-aware IO type, and take ownership of the fd handle. Call `open(Libc.dup(fd))` to avoid the ownership capture of the original handle.

!!! warning
    Do not call this on a handle that's already owned by some other part of the system.


```
open(command, mode::AbstractString, stdio=devnull)
```

Run `command` asynchronously. Like `open(command, stdio; read, write)` except specifying the read and write flags via a mode string instead of keyword arguments. Possible mode strings are:

| Mode | Description | Keywords                    |
|:---- |:----------- |:--------------------------- |
| `r`  | read        | none                        |
| `w`  | write       | `write = true`              |
| `r+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |
| `w+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |

```
open(command, stdio=devnull; write::Bool = false, read::Bool = !write)
```

Start running `command` asynchronously, and return a `process::IO` object.  If `read` is true, then reads from the process come from the process's standard output and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard input stream.  If `write` is true, then writes go to the process's standard input and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard output stream. The process's standard error stream is connected to the current global `stderr`.

```
open(f::Function, command, args...; kwargs...)
```

Similar to `open(command, args...; kwargs...)`, but calls `f(stream)` on the resulting process stream, then closes the input stream and waits for the process to complete. Return the value returned by `f` on success. Throw an error if the process failed, or if the process attempts to print anything to stdout.
```
operm(file)
```

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions for people who neither own the file nor are a member of the group owning the file
```
pairs(collection)
```

Return an iterator over `key => value` pairs for any collection that maps a set of keys to a set of values. This includes arrays, where the keys are the array indices.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict(zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]))
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> pairs(a)
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> foreach(println, pairs(["a", "b", "c"]))
1 => "a"
2 => "b"
3 => "c"

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> pairs |> collect
3-element Vector{Pair{Symbol, Int64}}:
 :a => 1
 :b => 2
 :c => 3

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> collect
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
pairs(IndexLinear(), A)
pairs(IndexCartesian(), A)
pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
```

An iterator that accesses each element of the array `A`, returning `i => x`, where `i` is the index for the element and `x = A[i]`. Identical to `pairs(A)`, except that the style of index can be selected. Also similar to `enumerate(A)`, except `i` will be a valid index for `A`, while `enumerate` always counts from 1 regardless of the indices of `A`.

Specifying [`IndexLinear()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be an integer; specifying [`IndexCartesian()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be a [`CartesianIndex`](@ref); specifying `IndexStyle(A)` chooses whichever has been defined as the native indexing style for array `A`.

Mutation of the bounds of the underlying array will invalidate this iterator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = ["a" "d"; "b" "e"; "c" "f"];

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
4 d
5 e
6 f

julia> S = view(A, 1:2, :);

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(S), S)
           println("$index $value")
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1) a
CartesianIndex(2, 1) b
CartesianIndex(1, 2) d
CartesianIndex(2, 2) e
```

See also [`IndexStyle`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref).
```
parent(A)
```

Return the underlying "parent array”. This parent array of objects of types `SubArray`, `ReshapedArray` or `LinearAlgebra.Transpose` is what was passed as an argument to `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, etc. during object creation. If the input is not a wrapped object, return the input itself. If the input is wrapped multiple times, only the outermost wrapper will be removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> V = view(A, 1:2, :)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1:2, :) with eltype Int64:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(V)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

```
```

```

Return the indices in the [`parent`](@ref) which correspond to the array view `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> V = view(A, 1, :)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1, :) with eltype Int64:
 1
 2

julia> parentindices(V)
(1, Base.Slice(Base.OneTo(2)))
```
```
parentmodule(m::Module) -> Module
```

Get a module's enclosing `Module`. `Main` is its own parent.

See also: [`names`](@ref), [`nameof`](@ref), [`fullname`](@ref), [`@__MODULE__`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parentmodule(Main)
Main

julia> parentmodule(Base.Broadcast)
Base
```

```
parentmodule(t::DataType) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the definition of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct Int end
       end
Foo

julia> parentmodule(Int)
Core

julia> parentmodule(Foo.Int)
Foo
```

```
parentmodule(f::Function) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the (first) definition of a generic function.

```
parentmodule(f::Function, types) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing a given definition of a generic function.
```
parse(type, str; base)
```

Parse a string as a number. For `Integer` types, a base can be specified (the default is 10). For floating-point types, the string is parsed as a decimal floating-point number.  `Complex` types are parsed from decimal strings of the form `"R±Iim"` as a `Complex(R,I)` of the requested type; `"i"` or `"j"` can also be used instead of `"im"`, and `"R"` or `"Iim"` are also permitted. If the string does not contain a valid number, an error is raised.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `parse(Bool, str)` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse(Int, "1234")
1234

julia> parse(Int, "1234", base = 5)
194

julia> parse(Int, "afc", base = 16)
2812

julia> parse(Float64, "1.2e-3")
0.0012

julia> parse(Complex{Float64}, "3.2e-1 + 4.5im")
0.32 + 4.5im
```

```
parse(::Type{Platform}, triplet::AbstractString)
```

Parses a string platform triplet back into a `Platform` object.
```
partialsort(v, k, by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Variant of [`partialsort!`](@ref) which copies `v` before partially sorting it, thereby returning the same thing as `partialsort!` but leaving `v` unmodified.
```
partialsort!(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Partially sort the vector `v` in place, according to the order specified by `by`, `lt` and `rev` so that the value at index `k` (or range of adjacent values if `k` is a range) occurs at the position where it would appear if the array were fully sorted via a non-stable algorithm. If `k` is a single index, that value is returned; if `k` is a range, an array of values at those indices is returned. Note that `partialsort!` does not fully sort the input array.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4)
4

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
partialsortperm(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return a partial permutation `I` of the vector `v`, so that `v[I]` returns values of a fully sorted version of `v` at index `k`. If `k` is a range, a vector of indices is returned; if `k` is an integer, a single index is returned. The order is specified using the same keywords as `sort!`. The permutation is stable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

Note that this function is equivalent to, but more efficient than, calling `sortperm(...)[k]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> v[partialsortperm(v, 1)]
1

julia> p = partialsortperm(v, 1:3)
3-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 1:3) with eltype Int64:
 2
 4
 3

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
```
```
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false, initialized=false)
```

Like [`partialsortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix` the same size as `v`, which is used to store (a permutation of) the indices of `v`.

If the index vector `ix` is initialized with the indices of `v` (or a permutation thereof), `initialized` should be set to `true`.

If `initialized` is `false` (the default), then `ix` is initialized to contain the indices of `v`.

If `initialized` is `true`, but `ix` does not contain (a permutation of) the indices of `v`, the behavior of `partialsortperm!` is undefined.

(Typically, the indices of `v` will be `1:length(v)`, although if `v` has an alternative array type with non-one-based indices, such as an `OffsetArray`, `ix` must also be an `OffsetArray` with the same indices, and must contain as values (a permutation of) these same indices.)

Upon return, `ix` is guaranteed to have the indices `k` in their sorted positions, such that

```julia
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k);
v[ix[k]] == partialsort(v, k)
```

The return value is the `k`th element of `ix` if `k` is an integer, or view into `ix` if `k` is a range.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> ix = Vector{Int}(undef, 4);

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 1)
2

julia> ix = [1:4;];

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 2:3, initialized=true)
2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 2:3) with eltype Int64:

```

```

```
```
pathof(m::Module)
```

Return the path of the `m.jl` file that was used to `import` module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package.

Use [`dirname`](@ref) to get the directory part and [`basename`](@ref) to get the file name part of the path.
```
peek(stream[, T=UInt8])
```

Read and return a value of type `T` from a stream without advancing the current position in the stream.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = IOBuffer("julia");

julia> peek(b)
0x6a

julia> position(b)
0

julia> peek(b, Char)
'j': ASCII/Unicode U+006A (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The method which accepts a type requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
permute!(v, p)
```

Permute vector `v` in-place, according to permutation `p`. No checking is done to verify that `p` is a permutation.

To return a new permutation, use `v[p]`. Note that this is generally faster than `permute!(v,p)` for large vectors.

See also [`invpermute!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> permute!(A, perm);

julia> A
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 3
 1
```

```
permute!(X::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         p::AbstractVector{<:Integer}, q::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         [C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

Bilaterally permute `A`, storing result `PAQ` (`A[p,q]`) in `X`. Stores intermediate result `(AQ)^T` (`transpose(A[:,q])`) in optional argument `C` if present. Requires that none of `X`, `A`, and, if present, `C` alias each other; to store result `PAQ` back into `A`, use the following method lacking `X`:

```
permute!(A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, p::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         q::AbstractVector{<:Integer}[, C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         [workcolptr::Vector{Ti}]]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

`X`'s dimensions must match those of `A` (`size(X, 1) == size(A, 1)` and `size(X, 2) == size(A, 2)`), and `X` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(X)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(X)) >= nnz(A)`). Column-permutation `q`'s length must match `A`'s column count (`length(q) == size(A, 2)`). Row-permutation `p`'s length must match `A`'s row count (`length(p) == size(A, 1)`).

`C`'s dimensions must match those of `transpose(A)` (`size(C, 1) == size(A, 2)` and `size(C, 2) == size(A, 1)`), and `C` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(C)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(C)) >= nnz(A)`).

For additional (algorithmic) information, and for versions of these methods that forgo argument checking, see (unexported) parent methods `unchecked_noalias_permute!` and `unchecked_aliasing_permute!`.

See also [`permute`](@ref).
```
permutedims(A::AbstractArray, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `A`. `perm` is a vector or a tuple of length `ndims(A)` specifying the permutation.

See also [`permutedims!`](@ref), [`PermutedDimsArray`](@ref), [`transpose`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

julia> perm = [4,1,3,2];

julia> size(permutedims(B, perm))
(13, 5, 11, 7)

julia> size(B)[perm] == ans
true
```

```
permutedims(m::AbstractMatrix)
```

Permute the dimensions of the matrix `m`, by flipping the elements across the diagonal of the matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> b = [5 6; 7 8];

julia> c = [9 10; 11 12];

julia> d = [13 14; 15 16];

julia> X = [[a] [b]; [c] [d]]

julia> permutedims(X)
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [9 10; 11 12]
 [5 6; 7 8]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> transpose(X)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [9 11; 10 12]
 [5 7; 6 8]  [13 15; 14 16]
```

```
permutedims(v::AbstractVector)
```

Reshape vector `v` into a `1 × length(v)` row matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> permutedims([1, 2, 3, 4])
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4

julia> V = [[[1 2; 3 4]]; [[5 6; 7 8]]]
2-element Vector{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]
 [5 6; 7 8]

julia> permutedims(V)
1×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [5 6; 7 8]

julia> transpose(V)
1×2 transpose(::Vector{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [5 7; 6 8]
```
```
permutedims!(dest, src, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `src` and store the result in the array `dest`. `perm` is a vector specifying a permutation of length `ndims(src)`. The preallocated array `dest` should have `size(dest) == size(src)[perm]` and is completely overwritten. No in-place permutation is supported and unexpected results will happen if `src` and `dest` have overlapping memory regions.

See also [`permutedims`](@ref).
```
pipeline(command; stdin, stdout, stderr, append=false)
```

Redirect I/O to or from the given `command`. Keyword arguments specify which of the command's streams should be redirected. `append` controls whether file output appends to the file. This is a more general version of the 2-argument `pipeline` function. `pipeline(from, to)` is equivalent to `pipeline(from, stdout=to)` when `from` is a command, and to `pipeline(to, stdin=from)` when `from` is another kind of data source.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`dothings`, stdout="out.txt", stderr="errs.txt"))
run(pipeline(`update`, stdout="log.txt", append=true))
```

```
pipeline(from, to, ...)
```

Create a pipeline from a data source to a destination. The source and destination can be commands, I/O streams, strings, or results of other `pipeline` calls. At least one argument must be a command. Strings refer to filenames. When called with more than two arguments, they are chained together from left to right. For example, `pipeline(a,b,c)` is equivalent to `pipeline(pipeline(a,b),c)`. This provides a more concise way to specify multi-stage pipelines.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`ls`, `grep xyz`))
run(pipeline(`ls`, "out.txt"))
run(pipeline("out.txt", `grep xyz`))
```
```
pkgdir(m::Module[, paths::String...])
```

Return the root directory of the package that imported module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package. Optionally further path component strings can be provided to construct a path within the package root.

```julia-repl
julia> pkgdir(Foo)
"/path/to/Foo.jl"

julia> pkgdir(Foo, "src", "file.jl")
"/path/to/Foo.jl/src/file.jl"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The optional argument `paths` requires at least Julia 1.7.

Binding `pkgversion` does not exist.
```
pointer(array [, index])
```

Get the native address of an array or string, optionally at a given location `index`.

This function is "unsafe". Be careful to ensure that a Julia reference to `array` exists as long as this pointer will be used. The [`GC.@preserve`](@ref) macro should be used to protect the `array` argument from garbage collection within a given block of code.

Calling [`Ref(array[, index])`](@ref Ref) is generally preferable to this function as it guarantees validity.
```
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

Get the memory address of a Julia object as a `Ptr`. The existence of the resulting `Ptr` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the `Ptr` will be used.

This function may not be called on immutable objects, since they do not have stable memory addresses.

See also [`unsafe_pointer_to_objref`](@ref).
```
pop!(collection) -> item
```

Remove an item in `collection` and return it. If `collection` is an ordered container, the last item is returned; for unordered containers, an arbitrary element is returned.

See also: [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), and [`push!`](@ref).

# Examples

2

julia> S
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  1

julia> pop!(Dict(1=>2))
1 => 2
```

```
pop!(collection, key[, default])
```

Delete and return the mapping for `key` if it exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>3);

julia> pop!(d, "a")
1

julia> pop!(d, "d")
ERROR: KeyError: key "d" not found
Stacktrace:
[...]

julia> pop!(d, "e", 4)
4
```
```
popat!(a::Vector, i::Integer, [default])
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return it. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap. When `i` is not a valid index for `a`, return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

See also: [`pop!`](@ref), [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.5.

```
popdisplay()
popdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pop the topmost backend off of the display-backend stack, or the topmost copy of `d` in the second variant.
```
popfirst!(collection) -> item
```

Remove the first `item` from `collection`.

This function is called `shift` in many other programming languages.

```
precision(num::AbstractFloat; base::Integer=2)
precision(T::Type; base::Integer=2)
```

Get the precision of a floating point number, as defined by the effective number of bits in the significand, or the precision of a floating-point type `T` (its current default, if `T` is a variable-precision type like [`BigFloat`](@ref)).

If `base` is specified, then it returns the maximum corresponding number of significand digits in that base.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"

precompile(f, args::Tuple{Vararg{Any}})
```

Compile the given function `f` for the argument tuple (of types) `args`, but do not execute it.
```
prepend!(a::Vector, collections...) -> collection
```

Insert the elements of each `collections` to the beginning of `a`.

When `collections` specifies multiple collections, order is maintained: elements of `collections[1]` will appear leftmost in `a`, and so on.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Specifying multiple collections to be prepended requires at least Julia 1.6.

prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `prevfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`nextfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
prevfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the largest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `y < x`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `-Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.
```
prevind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts before index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the previous character; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `1` return `0`. If `i` is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1` return `lastindex(str)`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `prevind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `prevind` would reach `0` then each remaining iteration decreases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `prevind` can return a negative value.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `str` or is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevind("α", 3)
1

julia> prevind("α", 1)
0

julia> prevind("α", 0)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [0]

```
```
prevpow(a, x)
```

The largest `a^n` not greater than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must not be less than 1.

```
```
print([io::IO], xs...)
```

Write to `io` (or to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref) if `io` is not given) a canonical (un-decorated) text representation. The representation used by `print` includes minimal formatting and tries to avoid Julia-specific details.

`print` falls back to calling `show`, so most types should just define `show`. Define `print` if your type has a separate "plain" representation. For example, `show` displays strings with quotes, and `print` displays strings without quotes.

See also [`println`](@ref), [`string`](@ref), [`printstyled`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> print(io, "Hello", ' ', :World!)

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello World!"
```
```
println([io::IO], xs...)
```

Print (using [`print`](@ref)) `xs` to `io` followed by a newline. If `io` is not supplied, prints to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref).

See also [`printstyled`](@ref) to add colors etc.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println("Hello, world")
Hello, world

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> println(io, "Hello", ',', " world.")

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello, world.\n"
```
```
printstyled([io], xs...; bold::Bool=false, underline::Bool=false, blink::Bool=false, reverse::Bool=false, hidden::Bool=false, color::Union{Symbol,Int}=:normal)
```

Print `xs` in a color specified as a symbol or integer, optionally in bold.

Keyword `color` may take any of the values `:normal`, `:default`, `:bold`, `:black`, `:blink`, `:blue`, `:cyan`, `:green`, `:hidden`, `:light_black`, `:light_blue`, `:light_cyan`, `:light_green`, `:light_magenta`, `:light_red`, `:light_white`, `:light_yellow`, `:magenta`, `:nothing`, `:red`, `:reverse`, `:underline`, `:white`, or  `:yellow` or an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive. Note that not all terminals support 256 colors.

Keywords `bold=true`, `underline=true`, `blink=true` are self-explanatory. Keyword `reverse=true` prints with foreground and background colors exchanged, and `hidden=true` should be invisibe in the terminal but can still be copied. These properties can be used in any combination.

See also [`print`](@ref), [`println`](@ref), [`show`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Keywords except `color` and `bold` were added in Julia 1.7.

Returns the product of `f` applied to each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prod(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
576
```

```
prod(itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of all elements of a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"

julia> prod(1:5; init = 1.0)
120.0
```

```
prod(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply elements of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8

julia> prod(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  2
 12
```

```
prod(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply the results of calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 9  64

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
   4
 144
```
```
prod!(r, A)
```

Multiply elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod!([1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
  2
 12

julia> prod!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8
```
```
promote(xs...)
```

Convert all arguments to a common type, and return them all (as a tuple). If no arguments can be converted, an error is raised.

See also: [`promote_type`], [`promote_rule`].

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote(Int8(1), Float16(4.5), Float32(4.1))
(1.0f0, 4.5f0, 4.1f0)
```
```
promote_rule(type1, type2)
```

Specifies what type should be used by [`promote`](@ref) when given values of types `type1` and `type2`. This function should not be called directly, but should have definitions added to it for new types as appropriate.
```
promote_shape(s1, s2)
```

Check two array shapes for compatibility, allowing trailing singleton dimensions, and return whichever shape has more dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = fill(1, (3,4,1,1,1));

julia> b = fill(1, (3,4));

julia> promote_shape(a,b)
(Base.OneTo(3), Base.OneTo(4), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1))

julia> promote_shape((2,3,1,4), (2, 3, 1, 4, 1))
(2, 3, 1, 4, 1)
```
```
promote_type(type1, type2)
```

Promotion refers to converting values of mixed types to a single common type. `promote_type` represents the default promotion behavior in Julia when operators (usually mathematical) are given arguments of differing types. `promote_type` generally tries to return a type which can at least approximate most values of either input type without excessively widening.  Some loss is tolerated; for example, `promote_type(Int64, Float64)` returns [`Float64`](@ref) even though strictly, not all [`Int64`](@ref) values can be represented exactly as `Float64` values.

See also: [`promote`](@ref), [`promote_typejoin`](@ref), [`promote_rule`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote_type(Int64, Float64)
Float64

julia> promote_type(Int32, Int64)
Int64

julia> promote_type(Float32, BigInt)
BigFloat

julia> promote_type(Int16, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int64, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int8, UInt16)
UInt16
```

!!! warning "Don't overload this directly"
    To overload promotion for your own types you should overload [`promote_rule`](@ref). `promote_type` calls `promote_rule` internally to determine the type. Overloading `promote_type` directly can cause ambiguity errors.

```
propertynames(x, private=false)
```

Get a tuple or a vector of the properties (`x.property`) of an object `x`. This is typically the same as [`fieldnames(typeof(x))`](@ref), but types that overload [`getproperty`](@ref) should generally overload `propertynames` as well to get the properties of an instance of the type.

`propertynames(x)` may return only "public" property names that are part of the documented interface of `x`.   If you want it to also return "private" fieldnames intended for internal use, pass `true` for the optional second argument. REPL tab completion on `x.` shows only the `private=false` properties.

See also: [`hasproperty`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).
```
push!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` in `collection`. If `collection` is an ordered container, the items are inserted at the end (in the given order).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> push!([1, 2, 3], 4, 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```

If `collection` is ordered, use [`append!`](@ref) to add all the elements of another collection to it. The result of the preceding example is equivalent to `append!([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`. For `AbstractSet` objects, [`union!`](@ref) can be used instead.

See [`sizehint!`](@ref) for notes about the performance model.

See also [`pushfirst!`](@ref).
```
pushdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pushes a new display `d` on top of the global display-backend stack. Calling `display(x)` or `display(mime, x)` will display `x` on the topmost compatible backend in the stack (i.e., the topmost backend that does not throw a [`MethodError`](@ref)).
```
pushfirst!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` at the beginning of `collection`.

This function is called `unshift` in many other programming languages.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> pushfirst!([1, 2, 3, 4], 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 1
 2
 3
 4
```
```
put!(c::Channel, v)
```

Append an item `v` to the channel `c`. Blocks if the channel is full.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`take!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `v` now gets converted to the channel's type with [`convert`](@ref) as `put!` is called.


```
put!(rr::Future, v)
```

Store a value to a [`Future`](@ref) `rr`. `Future`s are write-once remote references. A `put!` on an already set `Future` throws an `Exception`. All asynchronous remote calls return `Future`s and set the value to the return value of the call upon completion.

```
put!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Store a set of values to the [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). If the channel is full, blocks until space is available. Return the first argument.
```
pwd() -> AbstractString
```

Get the current working directory.

See also: [`cd`](@ref), [`tempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"
```
```
rad2deg(x)
```

Convert `x` from radians to degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rad2deg(pi)
180.0
```
```
rand([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [S], [dims...])
```

Pick a random element or array of random elements from the set of values specified by `S`; `S` can be

  * an indexable collection (for example `1:9` or `('x', "y", :z)`),
  * an `AbstractDict` or `AbstractSet` object,
  * a string (considered as a collection of characters), or
  * a type: the set of values to pick from is then equivalent to `typemin(S):typemax(S)` for integers (this is not applicable to [`BigInt`](@ref)), to $[0, 1)$ for floating point numbers and to $[0, 1)+i[0, 1)$ for complex floating point numbers;

`S` defaults to [`Float64`](@ref). When only one argument is passed besides the optional `rng` and is a `Tuple`, it is interpreted as a collection of values (`S`) and not as `dims`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Support for `S` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Int, 2)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1339893410598768192
 1575814717733606317

julia> using Random

julia> rand(MersenneTwister(0), Dict(1=>2, 3=>4))

 0.696556  0.783855   0.938235
```

!!! note
    The complexity of `rand(rng, s::Union{AbstractDict,AbstractSet})` is linear in the length of `s`, unless an optimized method with constant complexity is available, which is the case for `Dict`, `Set` and dense `BitSet`s. For more than a few calls, use `rand(rng, collect(s))` instead, or either `rand(rng, Dict(s))` or `rand(rng, Set(s))` as appropriate.

```
randn([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [T=Float64], [dims...])
```

Generate a normally-distributed random number of type `T` with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Optionally generate an array of normally-distributed random numbers. The `Base` module currently provides an implementation for the types [`Float16`](@ref), [`Float32`](@ref), and [`Float64`](@ref) (the default), and their [`Complex`](@ref) counterparts. When the type argument is complex, the values are drawn from the circularly symmetric complex normal distribution of variance 1 (corresponding to real and imaginary part having independent normal distribution with mean zero and variance `1/2`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using Random

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234);

julia> randn(rng, ComplexF64)
0.6133070881429037 - 0.6376291670853887im

julia> randn(rng, ComplexF32, (2, 3))
2×3 Matrix{ComplexF32}:
 -0.349649-0.638457im  0.376756-0.192146im  -0.396334-0.0136413im

```
```
range(start, stop, length)
range(start, stop; length, step)
range(start; length, stop, step)
range(;start, length, stop, step)
```

Construct a specialized array with evenly spaced elements and optimized storage (an [`AbstractRange`](@ref)) from the arguments. Mathematically a range is uniquely determined by any three of `start`, `step`, `stop` and `length`. Valid invocations of range are:

  * Call `range` with any three of `start`, `step`, `stop`, `length`.
  * Call `range` with two of `start`, `stop`, `length`. In this case `step` will be assumed to be one. If both arguments are Integers, a [`UnitRange`](@ref) will be returned.
  * Call `range` with one of `stop` or `length`. `start` and `step` will be assumed to be one.

See Extended Help for additional details on the returned type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, length=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, stop=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, step=5, length=100)
1:5:496

julia> range(1, step=5, stop=100)
1:5:96

julia> range(1, 10, length=101)
1.0:0.09:10.0

julia> range(1, 100, step=5)
1:5:96

julia> range(stop=10, length=5)
6:10

julia> range(stop=10, step=1, length=5)
6:1:10

julia> range(start=1, step=1, stop=10)
1:1:10

julia> range(; length = 10)
Base.OneTo(10)

julia> range(; stop = 6)
Base.OneTo(6)

julia> range(; stop = 6.5)
1.0:1.0:6.0
```

If `length` is not specified and `stop - start` is not an integer multiple of `step`, a range that ends before `stop` will be produced.

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, 3.5, step=2)
1.0:2.0:3.0
```

Special care is taken to ensure intermediate values are computed rationally. To avoid this induced overhead, see the [`LinRange`](@ref) constructor.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `stop` as a positional argument requires at least Julia 1.1.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The versions without keyword arguments and `start` as a keyword argument require at least Julia 1.7.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The versions with `stop` as a sole keyword argument, or `length` as a sole keyword argument require at least Julia 1.8.


# Extended Help

`range` will produce a `Base.OneTo` when the arguments are Integers and

  * Only `length` is provided
  * Only `stop` is provided

`range` will produce a `UnitRange` when the arguments are Integers and

  * Only `start`  and `stop` are provided
  * Only `length` and `stop` are provided

A `UnitRange` is not produced if `step` is provided even if specified as one.
```
rationalize([T<:Integer=Int,] x; tol::Real=eps(x))
```

Approximate floating point number `x` as a [`Rational`](@ref) number with components of the given integer type. The result will differ from `x` by no more than `tol`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rationalize(5.6)
28//5

julia> a = rationalize(BigInt, 10.3)
103//10

julia> typeof(numerator(a))
BigInt
```
```
read(io::IO, T)
```

Read a single value of type `T` from `io`, in canonical binary representation.

Note that Julia does not convert the endianness for you. Use [`ntoh`](@ref) or [`ltoh`](@ref) for this purpose.

```
read(io::IO, String)
```

Read the entirety of `io`, as a `String` (see also [`readchomp`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, String)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization"
```

```
read(filename::AbstractString, args...)
```

Open a file and read its contents. `args` is passed to `read`: this is equivalent to `open(io->read(io, args...), filename)`.

```
read(filename::AbstractString, String)
```

Read the entire contents of a file as a string.

```
read(s::IO, nb=typemax(Int))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

```
read(s::IOStream, nb::Integer; all=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.

```
read(command::Cmd)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as an array of bytes.

```
read(command::Cmd, String)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as a `String`.
```
read!(stream::IO, array::AbstractArray)
read!(filename::AbstractString, array::AbstractArray)
```

Read binary data from an I/O stream or file, filling in `array`.
```
readavailable(stream)
```

Read available buffered data from a stream. Actual I/O is performed only if no data has already been buffered. The result is a `Vector{UInt8}`.

!!! warning
    The amount of data returned is implementation-dependent; for example it can depend on the internal choice of buffer size. Other functions such as [`read`](@ref) should generally be used instead.

```
readbytes!(stream::IO, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

```
readbytes!(stream::IOStream, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b); all::Bool=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.
```
readchomp(x)
```

Read the entirety of `x` as a string and remove a single trailing newline if there is one. Equivalent to `chomp(read(x, String))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> readchomp("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members."

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```
```
readdir(dir::AbstractString=pwd();
    join::Bool = false,
    sort::Bool = true,
) -> Vector{String}
```

Return the names in the directory `dir` or the current working directory if not given. When `join` is false, `readdir` returns just the names in the directory as is; when `join` is true, it returns `joinpath(dir, name)` for each `name` so that the returned strings are full paths. If you want to get absolute paths back, call `readdir` with an absolute directory path and `join` set to true.

By default, `readdir` sorts the list of names it returns. If you want to skip sorting the names and get them in the order that the file system lists them, you can use `readdir(dir, sort=false)` to opt out of sorting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `join` and `sort` keyword arguments require at least Julia 1.4.

readeach(io::IO, T)
```

Return an iterable object yielding [`read(io, T)`](@ref).

See also [`skipchars`](@ref), [`eachline`](@ref), [`readuntil`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `readeach` requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
```
readline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read a single line of text from the given I/O stream or file (defaults to `stdin`). When reading from a file, the text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. Lines in the input end with `'\n'` or `"\r\n"` or the end of an input stream. When `keep` is false (as it is by default), these trailing newline characters are removed from the line before it is returned. When `keep` is true, they are returned as part of the line.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readline("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> readline("my_file.txt", keep=true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```

```julia-repl
julia> print("Enter your name: ")
Enter your name:

julia> your_name = readline()
Logan
"Logan"
```
```
readlines(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readlines(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read all lines of an I/O stream or a file as a vector of strings. Behavior is equivalent to saving the result of reading [`readline`](@ref) repeatedly with the same arguments and saving the resulting lines as a vector of strings.  See also [`eachline`](@ref) to iterate over the lines without reading them all at once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readlines("my_file.txt")
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."
 "It has many members."

julia> readlines("my_file.txt", keep=true)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"
 "It has many members.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
readlink(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Return the target location a symbolic link `path` points to.
```
readuntil(stream::IO, delim; keep::Bool = false)
readuntil(filename::AbstractString, delim; keep::Bool = false)
```

Read a string from an I/O stream or a file, up to the given delimiter. The delimiter can be a `UInt8`, `AbstractChar`, string, or vector. Keyword argument `keep` controls whether the delimiter is included in the result. The text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", 'L')
"Julia"

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", '.', keep = true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
real(z)
```

Return the real part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`imag`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`complex`](@ref), [`isreal`](@ref), [`Real`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(1 + 3im)
1
```

```
real(T::Type)
```

Return the type that represents the real part of a value of type `T`. e.g: for `T == Complex{R}`, returns `R`. Equivalent to `typeof(real(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(Complex{Int})
Int64

julia> real(Float64)
Float64
```

```
real(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the real part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `real.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0
 3

julia> real(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
2
```
```
realpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Canonicalize a path by expanding symbolic links and removing "." and ".." entries. On case-insensitive case-preserving filesystems (typically Mac and Windows), the filesystem's stored case for the path is returned.

(This function throws an exception if `path` does not exist in the filesystem.)

Boolean type, containing the values `true` and `false`.

`Bool` is a kind of number: `false` is numerically equal to `0` and `true` is numerically equal to `1`. Moreover, `false` acts as a multiplicative "strong zero":

```jldoctest
julia> false == 0
true

julia> true == 1
true

julia> 0 * NaN
NaN

julia> false * NaN
0.0
```

```
redirect_stdio(;stdin=stdin, stderr=stderr, stdout=stdout)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`. Each argument must be an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


```
redirect_stdio(f; stdin=nothing, stderr=nothing, stdout=nothing)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`, call `f()` and restore each stream.

Possible values for each stream are:

  * `nothing` indicating the stream should not be redirected.
  * `path::AbstractString` redirecting the stream to the file at `path`.
  * `io` an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="stdout.txt", stderr="stderr.txt") do
           print("hello stdout")
           print(stderr, "hello stderr")
       end

julia> read("stdout.txt", String)
"hello stdout"

julia> read("stderr.txt", String)
"hello stderr"
```

# Edge cases

It is possible to pass the same argument to `stdout` and `stderr`:

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="log.txt", stderr="log.txt", stdin=devnull) do
    ...
end
```

However it is not supported to pass two distinct descriptors of the same file.

```julia-repl
julia> io1 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> io2 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io1, stderr=io2) # not suppored
```

Also the `stdin` argument may not be the same descriptor as `stdout` or `stderr`.

```julia-repl
julia> io = open(...)

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io, stdin=io) # not supported
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
redisplay(x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
redisplay(mime, x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

By default, the `redisplay` functions simply call [`display`](@ref). However, some display backends may override `redisplay` to modify an existing display of `x` (if any). Using `redisplay` is also a hint to the backend that `x` may be redisplayed several times, and the backend may choose to defer the display until (for example) the next interactive prompt.
```
reduce(op, itr; [init])
```

Reduce the given collection `itr` with the given binary operator `op`. If provided, the initial value `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

For empty collections, providing `init` will be necessary, except for some special cases (e.g. when `op` is one of `+`, `*`, `max`, `min`, `&`, `|`) when Julia can determine the neutral element of `op`.

Reductions for certain commonly-used operators may have special implementations, and should be used instead: `maximum(itr)`, `minimum(itr)`, `sum(itr)`, `prod(itr)`,  `any(itr)`, `all(itr)`.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation dependent. This means that you can't use non-associative operations like `-` because it is undefined whether `reduce(-,[1,2,3])` should be evaluated as `(1-2)-3` or `1-(2-3)`. Use [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

Some operations accumulate error. Parallelism will be easier if the reduction can be executed in groups. Future versions of Julia might change the algorithm. Note that the elements are not reordered if you use an ordered collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4])
24

julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4]; init=-1)
-24
```

```
reduce(f, A; dims=:, [init])
```

Reduce 2-argument function `f` along dimensions of `A`. `dims` is a vector specifying the dimensions to reduce, and the keyword argument `init` is the initial value to use in the reductions. For `+`, `*`, `max` and `min` the `init` argument is optional.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent; if you need a particular associativity, e.g. left-to-right, you should write your own loop or consider using [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref). See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=2)
4×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 13
 14
 15
 16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  8  12  16
```
```
reenable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Re-enable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function. Temporarily reverses the effect of [`disable_sigint`](@ref).
```
reim(z)
```

Return a tuple of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number `z`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim(1 + 3im)
(1, 3)
```

```
reim(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return a tuple of two arrays containing respectively the real and the imaginary part of each entry in `A`.

Equivalent to `(real.(A), imag.(A))`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying to represent the real part, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
([1, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4])

julia> reim(fill(2 - im))
(fill(2), fill(-1))
```
```
reinterpret(type, A)
```

Change the type-interpretation of a block of memory. For arrays, this constructs a view of the array with the same binary data as the given array, but with the specified element type. For example, `reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))` interprets the 4 bytes corresponding to `UInt32(7)` as a [`Float32`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))
1.0f-44

julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32[1 2 3 4 5])
1×5 reinterpret(Float32, ::Matrix{UInt32}):
 1.0f-45  3.0f-45  4.0f-45  6.0f-45  7.0f-45
```

```
reinterpret(reshape, T, A::AbstractArray{S}) -> B
```

Change the type-interpretation of `A` while consuming or adding a "channel dimension."

If `sizeof(T) = n*sizeof(S)` for `n>1`, `A`'s first dimension must be of size `n` and `B` lacks `A`'s first dimension. Conversely, if `sizeof(S) = n*sizeof(T)` for `n>1`, `B` gets a new first dimension of size `n`. The dimensionality is unchanged if `sizeof(T) == sizeof(S)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int}, A)    # the result is a vector
2-element reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int64}, ::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1 + 3im
 2 + 4im

julia> a = [(1,2,3), (4,5,6)]
2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}:
 (1, 2, 3)
 (4, 5, 6)

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Int, a)             # the result is a matrix
3×2 reinterpret(reshape, Int64, ::Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}) with eltype Int64:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6
```
```
relpath(path::AbstractString, startpath::AbstractString = ".") -> AbstractString
```

Return a relative filepath to `path` either from the current directory or from an optional start directory. This is a path computation: the filesystem is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of `path` or `startpath`.

On Windows, case sensitivity is applied to every part of the path except drive letters. If `path` and `startpath` refer to different drives, the absolute path of `path` is returned.
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
rem2pi(x, r::RoundingMode)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `2π`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - 2π*round(x/(2π),r)
```

without any intermediate rounding. This internally uses a high precision approximation of 2π, and so will give a more accurate result than `rem(x,2π,r)`

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is in the interval $[-π, π]$. This will generally be the most accurate result. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$ if `x` is positive,. or $[-2π, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval $[-2π, 0]$. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rem2pi(7pi/4, RoundNearest)
-0.7853981633974485

julia> rem2pi(7pi/4, RoundDown)
5.497787143782138
```
```
repeat(A::AbstractArray, counts::Integer...)
```

Construct an array by repeating array `A` a given number of times in each dimension, specified by `counts`.

See also: [`fill`](@ref), [`Iterators.repeated`](@ref), [`Iterators.cycle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 1
 2
 3

julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2, 3)
6×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
```

```
repeat(A::AbstractArray; inner=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)), outer=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)))
```

Construct an array by repeating the entries of `A`. The i-th element of `inner` specifies the number of times that the individual entries of the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. The i-th element of `outer` specifies the number of times that a slice along the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. If `inner` or `outer` are omitted, no repetition is performed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat(1:2, inner=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
 2

julia> repeat(1:2, outer=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 1

 1  2  1  2  1  2
 3  4  3  4  3  4
 3  4  3  4  3  4
```

```
repeat(s::AbstractString, r::Integer)
```

Repeat a string `r` times. This can be written as `s^r`.

See also [`^`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat("ha", 3)
"hahaha"
```

```
repeat(c::AbstractChar, r::Integer) -> String
```

Repeat a character `r` times. This can equivalently be accomplished by calling [`c^r`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat('A', 3)
"AAA"
```
```
replace(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of collection `A` where, for each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, all occurrences of `old` are replaced by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total.

The element type of the result is chosen using promotion (see [`promote_type`](@ref)) based on the element type of `A` and on the types of the `new` values in pairs. If `count` is omitted and the element type of `A` is a `Union`, the element type of the result will not include singleton types which are replaced with values of a different type: for example, `Union{T,Missing}` will become `T` if `missing` is replaced.

See also [`replace!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`insert!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.


# Examples

 3

julia> replace([1, missing], missing=>0)
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

```

```
replace(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of `A` where each value `x` in `A` is replaced by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.


# Examples

  3 => 4
  1 => 3
```

```
replace(s::AbstractString, pat=>r, [pat2=>r2, ...]; [count::Integer])
```

Search for the given pattern `pat` in `s`, and replace each occurrence with `r`. If `count` is provided, replace at most `count` occurrences. `pat` may be a single character, a vector or a set of characters, a string, or a regular expression. If `r` is a function, each occurrence is replaced with `r(s)` where `s` is the matched substring (when `pat` is a `AbstractPattern` or `AbstractString`) or character (when `pat` is an `AbstractChar` or a collection of `AbstractChar`). If `pat` is a regular expression and `r` is a [`SubstitutionString`](@ref), then capture group references in `r` are replaced with the corresponding matched text. To remove instances of `pat` from `string`, set `r` to the empty `String` (`""`).

Multiple patterns can be specified, and they will be applied left-to-right simultaneously, so only one pattern will be applied to any character, and the patterns will only be applied to the input text, not the replacements.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Support for multiple patterns requires version 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace("Python is a programming language.", "Python" => "Julia")
"Julia is a programming language."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", "quick" => "slow", count=1)
"The slow foxes run quickly."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", "quick" => "", count=1)
"The  foxes run quickly."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", r"fox(es)?" => s"bus\1")
"The quick buses run quickly."

julia> replace("abcabc", "a" => "b", "b" => "c", r".+" => "a")
"bca"
```
```
replace!(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

For each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, replace all occurrences of `old` in collection `A` by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total. See also [`replace`](@ref replace(A, old_new::Pair...)).

# Examples

```

```
replace!(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Replace each element `x` in collection `A` by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

# Examples

  6
  12
```
```
replaceproperty!(x, f::Symbol, expected, desired, success_order::Symbol=:not_atomic, fail_order::Symbol=success_order)
```

Perform a compare-and-swap operation on `x.f` from `expected` to `desired`, per egal. The syntax `@atomic_replace! x.f expected => desired` can be used instead of the function call form.

See also [`replacefield!`](@ref Core.replacefield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
repr(x; context=nothing)
```

Create a string from any value using the [`show`](@ref) function. You should not add methods to `repr`; define a `show` method instead.

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

Note that `repr(x)` is usually similar to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.  See also [`repr(MIME("text/plain"), x)`](@ref) to instead return a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed more for human consumption, equivalent to the REPL display of `x`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repr(1)
"1"

julia> repr(zeros(3))
"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

julia> repr(big(1/3))
"0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125"

julia> repr(big(1/3), context=:compact => true)
"0.333333"

```

```
repr(mime, x; context=nothing)
```

Returns an `AbstractString` or `Vector{UInt8}` containing the representation of `x` in the requested `mime` type, as written by [`show(io, mime, x)`](@ref) (throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if no appropriate `show` is available). An `AbstractString` is returned for MIME types with textual representations (such as `"text/html"` or `"application/postscript"`), whereas binary data is returned as `Vector{UInt8}`. (The function `istextmime(mime)` returns whether or not Julia treats a given `mime` type as text.)

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to `:key=>value` pair or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

As a special case, if `x` is an `AbstractString` (for textual MIME types) or a `Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types), the `repr` function assumes that `x` is already in the requested `mime` format and simply returns `x`. This special case does not apply to the `"text/plain"` MIME type. This is useful so that raw data can be passed to `display(m::MIME, x)`.

In particular, `repr("text/plain", x)` is typically a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed for human consumption.  See also [`repr(x)`](@ref) to instead return a string corresponding to [`show(x)`](@ref) that may be closer to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> repr("text/plain", A)
"2×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2\n 3  4"
```
```
reset(s::IO)
```

Reset a stream `s` to a previously marked position, and remove the mark. Return the previously marked position. Throw an error if the stream is not marked.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`unmark`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).

```
reset(::Event)
```

Reset an Event back into an un-set state. Then any future calls to `wait` will block until `notify` is called again.
```
reshape(A, dims...) -> AbstractArray
reshape(A, dims) -> AbstractArray
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with different dimension sizes or number of dimensions. The two arrays share the same underlying data, so that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

The new dimensions may be specified either as a list of arguments or as a shape tuple. At most one dimension may be specified with a `:`, in which case its length is computed such that its product with all the specified dimensions is equal to the length of the original array `A`. The total number of elements must not change.

```
resize!(a::Vector, n::Integer) -> Vector
```

Resize `a` to contain `n` elements. If `n` is smaller than the current collection length, the first `n` elements will be retained. If `n` is larger, the new elements are not guaranteed to be initialized.

# Examples

rethrow()
```

Rethrow the current exception from within a `catch` block. The rethrown exception will continue propagation as if it had not been caught.

!!! note
    The alternative form `rethrow(e)` allows you to associate an alternative exception object `e` with the current backtrace. However this misrepresents the program state at the time of the error so you're encouraged to instead throw a new exception using `throw(e)`. In Julia 1.1 and above, using `throw(e)` will preserve the root cause exception on the stack, as described in [`current_exceptions`](@ref).

```
retry(f;  delays=ExponentialBackOff(), check=nothing) -> Function
```

Return an anonymous function that calls function `f`.  If an exception arises, `f` is repeatedly called again, each time `check` returns `true`, after waiting the number of seconds specified in `delays`.  `check` should input `delays`'s current state and the `Exception`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Before Julia 1.2 this signature was restricted to `f::Function`.


# Examples

```julia
retry(f, delays=fill(5.0, 3))
retry(f, delays=rand(5:10, 2))
retry(f, delays=Base.ExponentialBackOff(n=3, first_delay=5, max_delay=1000))
retry(http_get, check=(s,e)->e.status == "503")(url)
retry(read, check=(s,e)->isa(e, IOError))(io, 128; all=false)
```
```
reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )
```

Return a copy of `v` reversed from start to stop.  See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy, and in-place [`reverse!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse(A)
5-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> reverse(A, 3, 5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 5

 3
```

```
reverse(A; dims=:)
```

Reverse `A` along dimension `dims`, which can be an integer (a single dimension), a tuple of integers (a tuple of dimensions) or `:` (reverse along all the dimensions, the default).  See also [`reverse!`](@ref) for in-place reversal.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = Int64[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reverse(b, dims=2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 4  3

julia> reverse(b)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Prior to Julia 1.6, only single-integer `dims` are supported in `reverse`.


```
reverse(s::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Reverses a string. Technically, this function reverses the codepoints in a string and its main utility is for reversed-order string processing, especially for reversed regular-expression searches. See also [`reverseind`](@ref) to convert indices in `s` to indices in `reverse(s)` and vice-versa, and `graphemes` from module `Unicode` to operate on user-visible "characters" (graphemes) rather than codepoints. See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy. Custom string types must implement the `reverse` function themselves and should typically return a string with the same type and encoding. If they return a string with a different encoding, they must also override `reverseind` for that string type to satisfy `s[reverseind(s,i)] == reverse(s)[i]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("JuliaLang")
"gnaLailuJ"
```

!!! note
    The examples below may be rendered differently on different systems. The comments indicate how they're supposed to be rendered


Combining characters can lead to surprising results:

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("ax̂e") # hat is above x in the input, above e in the output
"êxa"

julia> using Unicode

julia> join(reverse(collect(graphemes("ax̂e")))) # reverses graphemes; hat is above x in both in- and output
"ex̂a"
```

```
reverse(o::Base.Ordering)
```

reverses ordering specified by `o`.
```
reverse!(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]]) -> v
```

In-place version of [`reverse`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse!(A);

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
reverse!(A; dims=:)
```

Like [`reverse`](@ref), but operates in-place in `A`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Multidimensional `reverse!` requires Julia 1.6.

```
reverseind(v, i)
```

Given an index `i` in [`reverse(v)`](@ref), return the corresponding index in `v` so that `v[reverseind(v,i)] == reverse(v)[i]`. (This can be nontrivial in cases where `v` contains non-ASCII characters.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = "Julia🚀"
"Julia🚀"

julia> r = reverse(s)
"🚀ailuJ"

julia> for i in eachindex(s)
           print(r[reverseind(r, i)])
       end
Julia🚀
```
```
rm(path::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, recursive::Bool=false)
```

Delete the file, link, or empty directory at the given path. If `force=true` is passed, a non-existing path is not treated as error. If `recursive=true` is passed and the path is a directory, then all contents are removed recursively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> rm("my", recursive=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist", force=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist")
ERROR: IOError: unlink("this_file_does_not_exist"): no such file or directory (ENOENT)

```
rot180(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

```
rot180(A, k)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is even, this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a,1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

 2  1

julia> rot180(a,2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
rotl90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` left 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  4
 1  3
```

```
rotl90(A, k)
```

Left-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees counterclockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a,1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

```
```
rotr90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` right 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotr90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  1
 4  2
```

```
rotr90(A, k)
```

Right-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees clockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]

round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]])
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; digits=, base=10)
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; sigdigits=, base=10)
```

Return the nearest integral value of the same type as the complex-valued `z` to `z`, breaking ties using the specified [`RoundingMode`](@ref)s. The first [`RoundingMode`](@ref) is used for rounding the real components while the second is used for rounding the imaginary components.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> round(3.14 + 4.5im)
3.0 + 4.0im
```

```
round([T,] x, [r::RoundingMode])
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; digits::Integer=0, base = 10)
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; sigdigits::Integer, base = 10)
```

Rounds the number `x`.

Without keyword arguments, `x` is rounded to an integer value, returning a value of type `T`, or of the same type of `x` if no `T` is provided. An [`InexactError`](@ref) will be thrown if the value is not representable by `T`, similar to [`convert`](@ref).

If the `digits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of digits after the decimal place (or before if negative), in base `base`.

If the `sigdigits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of significant digits, in base `base`.

The [`RoundingMode`](@ref) `r` controls the direction of the rounding; the default is [`RoundNearest`](@ref), which rounds to the nearest integer, with ties (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer. Note that `round` may give incorrect results if the global rounding mode is changed (see [`rounding`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(1.7)
2.0

julia> round(Int, 1.7)
2

julia> round(1.5)
2.0

julia> round(2.5)
2.0

julia> round(pi; digits=2)
3.14

julia> round(pi; digits=3, base=2)
3.125

julia> round(123.456; sigdigits=2)
120.0

julia> round(357.913; sigdigits=4, base=2)
352.0
```

!!! note
    Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when operating on binary floating point numbers. For example, the [`Float64`](@ref) value represented by `1.15` is actually *less* than 1.15, yet will be rounded to 1.2. For example:

    ```jldoctest; setup = :(using Printf)
    julia> x = 1.15
    1.15

    julia> @sprintf "%.20f" x
    "1.14999999999999991118"

    julia> x < 115//100
    true

    julia> round(x, digits=1)
    1.2
    ```


# Extensions

To extend `round` to new numeric types, it is typically sufficient to define `Base.round(x::NewType, r::RoundingMode)`.

```
round(dt::TimeType, p::Period, [r::RoundingMode]) -> TimeType
```

Return the `Date` or `DateTime` nearest to `dt` at resolution `p`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 9:30 to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `round(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> round(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> round(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::TimeType, ::Period, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

```
round(x::Period, precision::T, [r::RoundingMode]) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 90 minutes to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `round(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> round(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> round(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::Period, ::T, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
rounding(T)
```

Get the current floating point rounding mode for type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion.

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available modes.
```
rpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the right with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rpad("March", 20)
"March               "
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
rsplit(s::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
rsplit(s::AbstractString, chars; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
```

Similar to [`split`](@ref), but starting from the end of the string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "M.a.r.c.h"
"M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, ".")
5-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M"
 "a"
 "r"
 "c"
 "h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=1)
1-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=2)
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c"
 "h"
```
```
rstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
rstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`lstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = rpad("March", 20)
"March               "

julia> rstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
run(command, args...; wait::Bool = true)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual). Throws an error if anything goes wrong, including the process exiting with a non-zero status (when `wait` is true).

The `args...` allow you to pass through file descriptors to the command, and are ordered like regular unix file descriptors (eg `stdin, stdout, stderr, FD(3), FD(4)...`).

If `wait` is false, the process runs asynchronously. You can later wait for it and check its exit status by calling `success` on the returned process object.

When `wait` is false, the process' I/O streams are directed to `devnull`. When `wait` is true, I/O streams are shared with the parent process. Use [`pipeline`](@ref) to control I/O redirection.
No documentation found.

Binding `samefile` does not exist.
```
schedule(t::Task, [val]; error=false)
```

Add a [`Task`](@ref) to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly when the system is otherwise idle, unless the task performs a blocking operation such as [`wait`](@ref).

If a second argument `val` is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the return value of [`yieldto`](@ref)) when it runs again. If `error` is `true`, the value is raised as an exception in the woken task.

!!! warning
    It is incorrect to use `schedule` on an arbitrary `Task` that has already been started. See [the API reference](@ref low-level-schedule-wait) for more information.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a5() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a5);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
true

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
searchsorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the range of indices of `a` which compare as equal to `x` (using binary search) according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order. Return an empty range located at the insertion point if `a` does not contain values equal to `x`.

See also: [`insorted`](@ref), [`searchsortedfirst`](@ref), [`sort`](@ref), [`findall`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3:3

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4:5

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3:2

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7:6

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1:0
```
```
searchsortedfirst(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the first value in `a` greater than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `lastindex(a) + 1` if `x` is greater than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

See also: [`searchsortedlast`](@ref), [`searchsorted`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1
```
```
searchsortedlast(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the last value in `a` less than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `firstindex(a) - 1` if `x` is less than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches

Compute the matrix secant of a square matrix `A`.
```
secd(x)
```

Compute the secant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
sech(x)

seek(s, pos)
```

Seek a stream to the given position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
seekend(s)
```

Seek a stream to its end.
```
seekstart(s)
```

Seek a stream to its beginning.

# Examples

```jldoctest

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> seekstart(io);

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
selectdim(A, d::Integer, i)
```

Return a view of all the data of `A` where the index for dimension `d` equals `i`.

Equivalent to `view(A,:,:,...,i,:,:,...)` where `i` is in position `d`.

See also: [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8]
2×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3) with eltype Int64:

2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3:4) with eltype Int64:
 3  4
 7  8
```
```
set_zero_subnormals(yes::Bool) -> Bool
```

If `yes` is `false`, subsequent floating-point operations follow rules for IEEE arithmetic on subnormal values ("denormals"). Otherwise, floating-point operations are permitted (but not required) to convert subnormal inputs or outputs to zero. Returns `true` unless `yes==true` but the hardware does not support zeroing of subnormal numbers.

`set_zero_subnormals(true)` can speed up some computations on some hardware. However, it can break identities such as `(x-y==0) == (x==y)`.

!!! warning
    This function only affects the current thread.

```
setcpuaffinity(original_command::Cmd, cpus) -> command::Cmd
```

Set the CPU affinity of the `command` by a list of CPU IDs (1-based) `cpus`.  Passing `cpus = nothing` means to unset the CPU affinity if the `original_command` has any.

This function is supported only in Linux and Windows.  It is not supported in macOS because libuv does not support affinity setting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

In Linux, the `taskset` command line program can be used to see how `setcpuaffinity` works.

```julia
julia> run(setcpuaffinity(`sh -c 'taskset -p $$'`, [1, 2, 5]));
pid 2273's current affinity mask: 13
```

Note that the mask value `13` reflects that the first, second, and the fifth bits (counting from the least significant position) are turned on:

```julia
julia> 0b010011
0x13
```
```
setdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set of elements in `s` but not in any of the iterables in `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

See also [`setdiff!`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> setdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
setdiff!(s, itrs...)
```

Remove from set `s` (in-place) each element of each iterable from `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([1, 3, 4, 5]);

julia> setdiff!(a, 1:2:6);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  4
```
```
setenv(command::Cmd, env; dir)
```

Set environment variables to use when running the given `command`. `env` is either a dictionary mapping strings to strings, an array of strings of the form `"var=val"`, or zero or more `"var"=>val` pair arguments. In order to modify (rather than replace) the existing environment, create `env` through `copy(ENV)` and then setting `env["var"]=val` as desired, or use [`addenv`](@ref).

The `dir` keyword argument can be used to specify a working directory for the command. `dir` defaults to the currently set `dir` for `command` (which is the current working directory if not specified already).

See also [`Cmd`](@ref), [`addenv`](@ref), [`ENV`](@ref), [`pwd`](@ref).
```
setindex!(collection, value, key...)
```

Store the given value at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...] = x` is converted by the compiler to `(setindex!(a, x, i, j, ...); x)`.

```
setindex!(A, X, inds...)
A[inds...] = X
```

Store values from array `X` within some subset of `A` as specified by `inds`. The syntax `A[inds...] = X` is equivalent to `(setindex!(A, X, inds...); X)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,2);

julia> setindex!(A, [10, 20], [1, 2]);

julia> A[[3, 4]] = [30, 40];

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 10.0  30.0
 20.0  40.0
```
```
setprecision([T=BigFloat,] precision::Int; base=2)
```

Set the precision (in bits, by default) to be used for `T` arithmetic. If `base` is specified, then the precision is the minimum required to give at least `precision` digits in the given `base`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.


```
setprecision(f::Function, [T=BigFloat,] precision::Integer; base=2)
```

Change the `T` arithmetic precision (in the given `base`) for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = precision(BigFloat)
setprecision(BigFloat, precision)
f()
setprecision(BigFloat, old)
```

Often used as `setprecision(T, precision) do ... end`

Note: `nextfloat()`, `prevfloat()` do not use the precision mentioned by `setprecision`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x)
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b = c` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

See also [`setfield!`](@ref Core.setfield!), [`propertynames`](@ref Base.propertynames) and [`getproperty`](@ref Base.getproperty).
```
setrounding(T, mode)
```

Set the rounding mode of floating point type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion. Other numerical functions may give incorrect or invalid values when using rounding modes other than the default [`RoundNearest`](@ref).

Note that this is currently only supported for `T == BigFloat`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


```
setrounding(f::Function, T, mode)
```

Change the rounding mode of floating point type `T` for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = rounding(T)
setrounding(T, mode)
f()
setrounding(T, old)
```

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available rounding modes.
```
show([io::IO = stdout], x)
```

Write a text representation of a value `x` to the output stream `io`. New types `T` should overload `show(io::IO, x::T)`. The representation used by `show` generally includes Julia-specific formatting and type information, and should be parseable Julia code when possible.

[`repr`](@ref) returns the output of `show` as a string.

To customize human-readable text output for objects of type `T`, define `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` instead. Checking the `:compact` [`IOContext`](@ref) property of `io` in such methods is recommended, since some containers show their elements by calling this method with `:compact => true`.

See also [`print`](@ref), which writes un-decorated representations.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> show("Hello World!")
"Hello World!"
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```

```
show(io::IO, mime, x)
```

The [`display`](@ref) functions ultimately call `show` in order to write an object `x` as a given `mime` type to a given I/O stream `io` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary to define a new `show` method for `T`, via: `show(io, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`, where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls [`write`](@ref) (or similar) to write that representation of `x` to `io`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use `MIME{Symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function `show(io, ::MIME"image/png", x::MyImage) = ...` to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable `AbstractDisplay` (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to `import Base.show` in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function `show`.

Technically, the `MIME"mime"` macro defines a singleton type for the given `mime` string, which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any given type.

The default MIME type is `MIME"text/plain"`. There is a fallback definition for `text/plain` output that calls `show` with 2 arguments, so it is not always necessary to add a method for that case. If a type benefits from custom human-readable output though, `show(::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` should be defined. For example, the `Day` type uses `1 day` as the output for the `text/plain` MIME type, and `Day(1)` as the output of 2-argument `show`.

Container types generally implement 3-argument `show` by calling `show(io, MIME"text/plain"(), x)` for elements `x`, with `:compact => true` set in an [`IOContext`](@ref) passed as the first argument.
```
showable(mime, x)
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object `x` can be written as the given `mime` type.

(By default, this is determined automatically by the existence of the corresponding [`show`](@ref) method for `typeof(x)`.  Some types provide custom `showable` methods; for example, if the available MIME formats depend on the *value* of `x`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> showable(MIME("text/plain"), rand(5))
true

julia> showable("image/png", rand(5))
false
```
```
showerror(io, e)
```

Show a descriptive representation of an exception object `e`. This method is used to display the exception after a call to [`throw`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyException <: Exception
           msg::String
       end

julia> function Base.showerror(io::IO, err::MyException)
           print(io, "MyException: ")
           print(io, err.msg)
       end

julia> err = MyException("test exception")
MyException("test exception")

julia> sprint(showerror, err)
"MyException: test exception"

julia> throw(MyException("test exception"))
ERROR: MyException: test exception
```
```
sign(x)
```

Return zero if `x==0` and $x/|x|$ otherwise (i.e., ±1 for real `x`).

See also [`signbit`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref), [`copysign`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sign(-4.0)
-1.0

julia> sign(99)
1

julia> sign(-0.0)
-0.0

julia> sign(0 + im)
0.0 + 1.0im
```
```
signbit(x)
```

Returns `true` if the value of the sign of `x` is negative, otherwise `false`.

See also [`sign`](@ref) and [`copysign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signbit(-4)
true

julia> signbit(5)
false

julia> signbit(5.5)
false

julia> signbit(-4.1)
true
```
```
signed(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the signed type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signed(UInt16)
Int16
julia> signed(UInt64)
Int64
```

```
signed(x)
```

Convert a number to a signed integer. If the argument is unsigned, it is reinterpreted as signed without checking for overflow.

See also: [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).
```
significand(x)
```

Extract the significand (a.k.a. mantissa) of a floating-point number. If `x` is a non-zero finite number, then the result will be a number of the same type and sign as `x`, and whose absolute value is on the interval $[1,2)$. Otherwise `x` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> significand(15.2)
1.9

julia> significand(-15.2)
-1.9

julia> significand(-15.2) * 2^3
-15.2

julia> significand(-Inf), significand(Inf), significand(NaN)
(-Inf, Inf, NaN)
```
```
similar(array, [element_type=eltype(array)], [dims=size(array)])
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array with the given element type and size, based upon the given source array. The second and third arguments are both optional, defaulting to the given array's `eltype` and `size`. The dimensions may be specified either as a single tuple argument or as a series of integer arguments.

Custom AbstractArray subtypes may choose which specific array type is best-suited to return for the given element type and dimensionality. If they do not specialize this method, the default is an `Array{element_type}(undef, dims...)`.

For example, `similar(1:10, 1, 4)` returns an uninitialized `Array{Int,2}` since ranges are neither mutable nor support 2 dimensions:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(1:10, 1, 4)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4419743872  4374413872  4419743888  0
```

Conversely, `similar(trues(10,10), 2)` returns an uninitialized `BitVector` with two elements since `BitArray`s are both mutable and can support 1-dimensional arrays:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(trues(10,10), 2)
2-element BitVector:
 0
 0
```

Since `BitArray`s can only store elements of type [`Bool`](@ref), however, if you request a different element type it will create a regular `Array` instead:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(falses(10), Float64, 2, 4)
2×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
```

See also: [`undef`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

```
similar(storagetype, axes)
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array analogous to that specified by `storagetype`, but with `axes` specified by the last argument.

**Examples**:

```
similar(Array{Int}, axes(A))
```

creates an array that "acts like" an `Array{Int}` (and might indeed be backed by one), but which is indexed identically to `A`. If `A` has conventional indexing, this will be identical to `Array{Int}(undef, size(A))`, but if `A` has unconventional indexing then the indices of the result will match `A`.

```
similar(BitArray, (axes(A, 2),))
```

would create a 1-dimensional logical array whose indices match those of the columns of `A`.
```
sin(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`sind`], [`sinpi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
sin(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the sine. Otherwise, the sine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sin(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649
```
```
sinc(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x) / (\pi x)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $1$ if $x = 0$.

See also [`cosc`](@ref), its derivative.
```
sincos(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians, returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

See also [`cis`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref).

```
sincos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine and cosine of a square matrix `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> S, C = sincos(fill(1.0, (2,2)));

julia> S
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649

julia> C
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
sincosd(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
sincospi(x)
```

Simultaneously compute [`sinpi(x)`](@ref) and [`cospi(x)`](@ref) (the sine and cosine of `π*x`, where `x` is in radians), returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.


See also: [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref), [`sinpi`](@ref).
```
sind(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
sinh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic sine of `x`.

```
sinh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic sine of a square matrix `A`.
```
sinpi(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x)$ more accurately than `sin(pi*x)`, especially for large `x`.

See also [`sind`](@ref), [`cospi`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref).
```
size(A::AbstractArray, [dim])
```

Return a tuple containing the dimensions of `A`. Optionally you can specify a dimension to just get the length of that dimension.

Note that `size` may not be defined for arrays with non-standard indices, in which case [`axes`](@ref) may be useful. See the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

See also: [`length`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`sizeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (2,3,4));

julia> size(A)
(2, 3, 4)

julia> size(A, 2)
3
```
```
sizehint!(s, n)
```

Suggest that collection `s` reserve capacity for at least `n` elements. This can improve performance.

# Notes on the performance model

For types that support `sizehint!`,

1. `push!` and `append!` methods generally may (but are not required to) preallocate extra storage. For types implemented in `Base`, they typically do, using a heuristic optimized for a general use case.
2. `sizehint!` may control this preallocation. Again, it typically does this for types in `Base`.
3. `empty!` is nearly costless (and O(1)) for types that support this kind of preallocation.
```
sizeof(T::DataType)
sizeof(obj)
```

Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given `DataType` `T`, if any. Or the size, in bytes, of object `obj` if it is not a `DataType`.

See also [`summarysize`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(Float32)
4

julia> sizeof(ComplexF64)
16

julia> sizeof(1.0)
8

julia> sizeof(collect(1.0:10.0))
80
```

If `DataType` `T` does not have a specific size, an error is thrown.

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(AbstractArray)
ERROR: Abstract type AbstractArray does not have a definite size.
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
sizeof(str::AbstractString)
```

Size, in bytes, of the string `str`. Equal to the number of code units in `str` multiplied by the size, in bytes, of one code unit in `str`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof("")
0

julia> sizeof("∀")
3
```
```
skip(s, offset)
```

Seek a stream relative to the current position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> skip(io, 10);

julia> read(io, Char)
'G': ASCII/Unicode U+0047 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
skipchars(predicate, io::IO; linecomment=nothing)
```

Advance the stream `io` such that the next-read character will be the first remaining for which `predicate` returns `false`. If the keyword argument `linecomment` is specified, all characters from that character until the start of the next line are ignored.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> buf = IOBuffer("    text")
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> skipchars(isspace, buf)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=5, mark=-1)

julia> String(readavailable(buf))
"text"
```
```
skipmissing(itr)
```

Return an iterator over the elements in `itr` skipping [`missing`](@ref) values. The returned object can be indexed using indices of `itr` if the latter is indexable. Indices corresponding to missing values are not valid: they are skipped by [`keys`](@ref) and [`eachindex`](@ref), and a `MissingException` is thrown when trying to use them.

Use [`collect`](@ref) to obtain an `Array` containing the non-`missing` values in `itr`. Note that even if `itr` is a multidimensional array, the result will always be a `Vector` since it is not possible to remove missings while preserving dimensions of the input.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`ismissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = skipmissing([1, missing, 2])
skipmissing(Union{Missing, Int64}[1, missing, 2])

julia> sum(x)
3

julia> x[1]
1

julia> x[2]
ERROR: MissingException: the value at index (2,) is missing
[...]

julia> argmax(x)
3

julia> collect(keys(x))
2-element Vector{Int64}:

 3

julia> collect(skipmissing([1, missing, 2]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> collect(skipmissing([1 missing; 2 missing]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
sleep(seconds)
```

Block the current task for a specified number of seconds. The minimum sleep time is 1 millisecond or input of `0.001`.
```
something(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`nothing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise throw an error. Arguments of type [`Some`](@ref) are unwrapped.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`@something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> something(nothing, 1)
1

julia> something(Some(1), nothing)

julia> something(missing, nothing)
missing

julia> something(nothing, nothing)
ERROR: ArgumentError: No value arguments present
```
```
sort(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Variant of [`sort!`](@ref) that returns a sorted copy of `v` leaving `v` itself unmodified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> sort(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 1
 2
```

```
sort(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort a multidimensional array `A` along the given dimension. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort(A, dims = 1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 4  3

julia> sort(A, dims = 2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  4
 1  2
```
```
sort!(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the vector `v` in place. [`QuickSort`](@ref) is used by default for numeric arrays while [`MergeSort`](@ref) is used for other arrays. You can specify an algorithm to use via the `alg` keyword (see [Sorting Algorithms](@ref) for available algorithms). The `by` keyword lets you provide a function that will be applied to each element before comparison; the `lt` keyword allows providing a custom "less than" function (note that for every `x` and `y`, only one of `lt(x,y)` and `lt(y,x)` can return `true`); use `rev=true` to reverse the sorting order. These options are independent and can be used together in all possible combinations: if both `by` and `lt` are specified, the `lt` function is applied to the result of the `by` function; `rev=true` reverses whatever ordering specified via the `by` and `lt` keywords.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; sort!(v); v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; sort!(v, rev = true); v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 2
 1

julia> v = [(1, "c"), (3, "a"), (2, "b")]; sort!(v, by = x -> x[1]); v
3-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, String}}:
 (1, "c")
 (2, "b")
 (3, "a")

julia> v = [(1, "c"), (3, "a"), (2, "b")]; sort!(v, by = x -> x[2]); v
3-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, String}}:
 (3, "a")
 (2, "b")
 (1, "c")
```

```
sort!(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=defalg(A), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the multidimensional array `A` along dimension `dims`. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort!(A, dims = 1); A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 4  3

julia> sort!(A, dims = 2); A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
sortperm(v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Return a permutation vector `I` that puts `v[I]` in sorted order. The order is specified using the same keywords as [`sort!`](@ref). The permutation is guaranteed to be stable even if the sorting algorithm is unstable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

See also [`sortperm!`](@ref), [`partialsortperm`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref), [`indexin`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> p = sortperm(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortperm!(ix, v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward, initialized::Bool=false)
```

Like [`sortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix`.  If `initialized` is `false` (the default), `ix` is initialized to contain the values `1:length(v)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; p = zeros(Int, 3);

julia> sortperm!(p, v); p
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortslices(A; dims, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort slices of an array `A`. The required keyword argument `dims` must be either an integer or a tuple of integers. It specifies the dimension(s) over which the slices are sorted.

E.g., if `A` is a matrix, `dims=1` will sort rows, `dims=2` will sort columns. Note that the default comparison function on one dimensional slices sorts lexicographically.

For the remaining keyword arguments, see the documentation of [`sort!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1) # Sort rows
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1   6  4
  7   3  5
  9  -2  8

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5
 -1   6  4

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, rev=true)

# Higher dimensions

`sortslices` extends naturally to higher dimensions. E.g., if `A` is a a 2x2x2 array, `sortslices(A, dims=3)` will sort slices within the 3rd dimension, passing the 2x2 slices `A[:, :, 1]` and `A[:, :, 2]` to the comparison function. Note that while there is no default order on higher-dimensional slices, you may use the `by` or `lt` keyword argument to specify such an order.

If `dims` is a tuple, the order of the dimensions in `dims` is relevant and specifies the linear order of the slices. E.g., if `A` is three dimensional and `dims` is `(1, 2)`, the orderings of the first two dimensions are re-arranged such that the slices (of the remaining third dimension) are sorted. If `dims` is `(2, 1)` instead, the same slices will be taken, but the result order will be row-major instead.

# Higher dimensional examples

splice!(a::Vector, index::Integer, [replacement]) -> item
```

Remove the item at the given index, and return the removed item. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gap. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed item.

See also: [`replace`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`pop!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; splice!(A, 5)
2

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6

 -1
```

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

```
splice!(a::Vector, indices, [replacement]) -> items
```

Remove items at specified indices, and return a collection containing the removed items. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gaps. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed items; in this case, `indices` must be a `AbstractUnitRange`.

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Prior to Julia 1.5, `indices` must always be a `UnitRange`.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Prior to Julia 1.8, `indices` must be a `UnitRange` if splicing in replacement values.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [-1, -2, -3, 5, 4, 3, -1]; splice!(A, 4:3, 2)

```
```
split(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
split(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` into an array of substrings on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm`.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`rsplit`](@ref), [`eachsplit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> split(a, ".")
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
splitdir(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

Split a path into a tuple of the directory name and file name.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitdir("/home/myuser")
("/home", "myuser")
```
```
splitdrive(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

On Windows, split a path into the drive letter part and the path part. On Unix systems, the first component is always the empty string.
```
splitext(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

If the last component of a path contains one or more dots, split the path into everything before the last dot and everything including and after the dot. Otherwise, return a tuple of the argument unmodified and the empty string. "splitext" is short for "split extension".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.jl")
("/home/myuser/example", ".jl")

julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.tar.gz")
("/home/myuser/example.tar", ".gz")

julia> splitext("/home/my.user/example")
("/home/my.user/example", "")
```
```
splitpath(path::AbstractString) -> Vector{String}
```

Split a file path into all its path components. This is the opposite of `joinpath`. Returns an array of substrings, one for each directory or file in the path, including the root directory if present.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitpath("/home/myuser/example.jl")
4-element Vector{String}:
 "/"
 "home"
 "myuser"
 "example.jl"
```
```
sprint(f::Function, args...; context=nothing, sizehint=0)
```

Call the given function with an I/O stream and the supplied extra arguments. Everything written to this I/O stream is returned as a string. `context` can be an [`IOContext`](@ref) whose properties will be used, a `Pair` specifying a property and its value, or a tuple of `Pair` specifying multiple properties and their values. `sizehint` suggests the capacity of the buffer (in bytes).

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `f`.  The optional `sizehint` is a suggested size (in bytes) to allocate for the buffer used to write the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sprint(show, 66.66666; context=:compact => true)
"66.6667"

julia> sprint(showerror, BoundsError([1], 100))
"BoundsError: attempt to access 1-element Vector{Int64} at index [100]"
```
```
sqrt(x)
```

Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.

See also: [`hypot`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> sqrt(big(81))
9.0

julia> sqrt(big(-81))
ERROR: DomainError with -81.0:

```
sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

If `A` is real-symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root.   For such matrices, eigenvalues λ that appear to be slightly negative due to roundoff errors are treated as if they were zero. More precisely, matrices with all eigenvalues `≥ -rtol*(max |λ|)` are treated as semidefinite (yielding a Hermitian square root), with negative eigenvalues taken to be zero. `rtol` is a keyword argument to `sqrt` (in the Hermitian/real-symmetric case only) that defaults to machine precision scaled by `size(A,1)`.

Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor. If a real square root exists, then an extension of this method [^H87] that computes the real Schur form and then the real square root of the quasi-triangular factor is instead used.

Binding `stack` does not exist.
```
stacktrace([trace::Vector{Ptr{Cvoid}},] [c_funcs::Bool=false]) -> StackTrace
```

Returns a stack trace in the form of a vector of `StackFrame`s. (By default stacktrace doesn't return C functions, but this can be enabled.) When called without specifying a trace, `stacktrace` first calls `backtrace`.
```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with `prefix`. If `prefix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the first character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`endswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", "Julia")
true
```

```
startswith(prefix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument starts with `prefix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> startswith(y, prefix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(startswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `startswith(prefix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith_julia = startswith("Julia");

julia> startswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> startswith_julia("NotJulia")
false
```

```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with the regex pattern, `prefix`.

!!! note
    `startswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"^...", s)` is faster than `startswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`endswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", r"Julia|Romeo")
true
```
```
stat(file)
```

Returns a structure whose fields contain information about the file. The fields of the structure are:

| Name    | Description                                                        |

| inode   | The inode number of the file                                       |
| mode    | The protection mode of the file                                    |
| nlink   | The number of hard links to the file                               |

```
step(r)
```

Get the step size of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) object.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> step(1:10)
1

julia> step(1:2:10)
2

julia> step(2.5:0.3:10.9)
0.3

julia> step(range(2.5, stop=10.9, length=85))
0.1
```
```
stride(A, k::Integer)
```

Return the distance in memory (in number of elements) between adjacent elements in dimension `k`.

See also: [`strides`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> stride(A,2)
3

julia> stride(A,3)
12
```
```
strides(A)
```

Return a tuple of the memory strides in each dimension.

See also: [`stride`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> strides(A)
(1, 3, 12)
```
```
string(n::Integer; base::Integer = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Convert an integer `n` to a string in the given `base`, optionally specifying a number of digits to pad to.

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string(5, base = 13, pad = 4)
"0005"

julia> string(-13, base = 5, pad = 4)
"-0023"
```

```
string(xs...)
```

Create a string from any values using the [`print`](@ref) function.

`string` should usually not be defined directly. Instead, define a method `print(io::IO, x::MyType)`. If `string(x)` for a certain type needs to be highly efficient, then it may make sense to add a method to `string` and define `print(io::IO, x::MyType) = print(io, string(x))` to ensure the functions are consistent.

See also: [`String`](@ref), [`repr`](@ref), [`sprint`](@ref), [`show`](@ref @show).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string("a", 1, true)
"a1true"
```
```
strip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
strip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading and trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading and trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, vector or set of characters.

See also [`lstrip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The method which accepts a predicate function requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strip("{3, 5}\n", ['{', '}', '\n'])
"3, 5"
```
```
success(command)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual), and tell whether it was successful (exited with a code of 0). An exception is raised if the process cannot be started.
```
sum(f, itr; [init])
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
29
```

Note the important difference between `sum(A)` and `reduce(+, A)` for arrays with small integer eltype:

```jldoctest
julia> sum(Int8[100, 28])
128

julia> reduce(+, Int8[100, 28])
-128
```

In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is 128. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in -128.

```
sum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the sum of all elements in a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.

 7
```

```
sum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

 10  20

julia> sum(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  5
 25
```
```
sum!(r, A)
```

Sum elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> sum!([1; 1], A)

 7

julia> sum!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  6
```
```
summary(io::IO, x)
str = summary(x)
```

Print to a stream `io`, or return a string `str`, giving a brief description of a value. By default returns `string(typeof(x))`, e.g. [`Int64`](@ref).

For arrays, returns a string of size and type info, e.g. `10-element Array{Int64,1}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> summary(1)
"Int64"

julia> summary(zeros(2))
"2-element Vector{Float64}"
```
```
supertype(T::DataType)
```

Return the supertype of DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> supertype(Int32)
Signed
```
```
swapproperty!(x, f::Symbol, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic a.b, _ = c, a.b` returns `(c, swapproperty!(a, :b, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where there must be one getfield expression common to both sides.

See also [`swapfield!`](@ref Core.swapfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
symdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of elements in the passed in sets. When `s` is not an `AbstractSet`, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.

See also [`symdiff!`](@ref), [`setdiff`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> symdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5], [4,5,6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> symdiff([1,2,1], [2, 1, 2])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> symdiff(unique([1,2,1]), unique([2, 1, 2]))
Int64[]
```
```
symdiff!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of the passed in sets, and overwrite `s` with the result. When `s` is an array, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.
```
symlink(target::AbstractString, link::AbstractString; dir_target = false)
```

Creates a symbolic link to `target` with the name `link`.

On Windows, symlinks must be explicitly declared as referring to a directory or not.  If `target` already exists, by default the type of `link` will be auto- detected, however if `target` does not exist, this function defaults to creating a file symlink unless `dir_target` is set to `true`.  Note that if the user sets `dir_target` but `target` exists and is a file, a directory symlink will still be created, but dereferencing the symlink will fail, just as if the user creates a file symlink (by calling `symlink()` with `dir_target` set to `false` before the directory is created) and tries to dereference it to a directory.

Additionally, there are two methods of making a link on Windows; symbolic links and junction points.  Junction points are slightly more efficient, but do not support relative paths, so if a relative directory symlink is requested (as denoted by `isabspath(target)` returning `false`) a symlink will be used, else a junction point will be used.  Best practice for creating symlinks on Windows is to create them only after the files/directories they reference are already created.

See also: [`hardlink`](@ref).

!!! note
    This function raises an error under operating systems that do not support soft symbolic links, such as Windows XP.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The `dir_target` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.6.  Prior to this, symlinks to nonexistant paths on windows would always be file symlinks, and relative symlinks to directories were not supported.

```
systemerror(sysfunc[, errno::Cint=Libc.errno()])
systemerror(sysfunc, iftrue::Bool)
```

Raises a `SystemError` for `errno` with the descriptive string `sysfunc` if `iftrue` is `true`
```
take!(b::IOBuffer)
```

Obtain the contents of an `IOBuffer` as an array. Afterwards, the `IOBuffer` is reset to its initial state.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."
```

```
take!(c::Channel)
```

Remove and return a value from a [`Channel`](@ref). Blocks until data is available.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`put!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

```
take!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Fetch value(s) from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) `rr`, removing the value(s) in the process.
```
tan(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
tan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the tangent. Otherwise, the tangent is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tan(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 -1.09252  -1.09252
 -1.09252  -1.09252
```
```
tand(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
tanh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
tanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic tangent of a square matrix `A`.
```
task_local_storage(key)
```

Look up the value of a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(key, value)
```

Assign a value to a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(body, key, value)
```

Call the function `body` with a modified task-local storage, in which `value` is assigned to `key`; the previous value of `key`, or lack thereof, is restored afterwards. Useful for emulating dynamic scoping.
```
tempdir()
```

Gets the path of the temporary directory. On Windows, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMP`, `TEMP`, `USERPROFILE`. On all other operating systems, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, and `TEMPDIR`. If none of these are found, the path `"/tmp"` is used.
```
tempname(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> String
```

Generate a temporary file path. This function only returns a path; no file is created. The path is likely to be unique, but this cannot be guaranteed due to the very remote posibility of two simultaneous calls to `tempname` generating the same file name. The name is guaranteed to differ from all files already existing at the time of the call to `tempname`.

When called with no arguments, the temporary name will be an absolute path to a temporary name in the system temporary directory as given by `tempdir()`. If a `parent` directory argument is given, the temporary path will be in that directory instead.

The `cleanup` option controls whether the process attempts to delete the returned path automatically when the process exits. Note that the `tempname` function does not create any file or directory at the returned location, so there is nothing to cleanup unless you create a file or directory there. If you do and `clean` is `true` it will be deleted upon process termination.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `parent` and `cleanup` arguments were added in 1.4. Prior to Julia 1.4 the path `tempname` would never be cleaned up at process termination.


!!! warning
    This can lead to security holes if another process obtains the same file name and creates the file before you are able to. Open the file with `JL_O_EXCL` if this is a concern. Using [`mktemp()`](@ref) is also recommended instead.

```
textwidth(c)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth('α')
1

julia> textwidth('⛵')
2
```

```
textwidth(s::AbstractString)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth("March")
5
```
```
thisind(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Int
```

If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding code unit `i` is part of. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return `i`; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to 0 or `ncodeunits(s)+1` return `i`. In all other cases throw `BoundsError`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> thisind("α", 0)
0

julia> thisind("α", 1)
1

julia> thisind("α", 2)
1

julia> thisind("α", 3)
3

julia> thisind("α", 4)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [4]
[...]

julia> thisind("α", -1)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [-1]
[...]
```
```
time(t::TmStruct)
```

Converts a `TmStruct` struct to a number of seconds since the epoch.

```
time()
```

Get the system time in seconds since the epoch, with fairly high (typically, microsecond) resolution.
```
time_ns()
```

Get the time in nanoseconds. The time corresponding to 0 is undefined, and wraps every 5.8 years.
```
timedwait(callback::Function, timeout::Real; pollint::Real=0.1)
```

Waits until `callback` returns `true` or `timeout` seconds have passed, whichever is earlier. `callback` is polled every `pollint` seconds. The minimum value for `timeout` and `pollint` is `0.001`, that is, 1 millisecond.

Returns :ok or :timed_out
```
titlecase(s::AbstractString; [wordsep::Function], strict::Bool=true) -> String
```

Capitalize the first character of each word in `s`; if `strict` is true, every other character is converted to lowercase, otherwise they are left unchanged. By default, all non-letters beginning a new grapheme are considered as word separators; a predicate can be passed as the `wordsep` keyword to determine which characters should be considered as word separators. See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref) to capitalize only the first character in `s`.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> titlecase("the JULIA programming language")
"The Julia Programming Language"

julia> titlecase("ISS - international space station", strict=false)
"ISS - International Space Station"

julia> titlecase("a-a b-b", wordsep = c->c==' ')
"A-a B-b"
```
```
to_indices(A, I::Tuple)
```

Convert the tuple `I` to a tuple of indices for use in indexing into array `A`.

The returned tuple must only contain either `Int`s or `AbstractArray`s of scalar indices that are supported by array `A`. It will error upon encountering a novel index type that it does not know how to process.

For simple index types, it defers to the unexported `Base.to_index(A, i)` to process each index `i`. While this internal function is not intended to be called directly, `Base.to_index` may be extended by custom array or index types to provide custom indexing behaviors.

More complicated index types may require more context about the dimension into which they index. To support those cases, `to_indices(A, I)` calls `to_indices(A, axes(A), I)`, which then recursively walks through both the given tuple of indices and the dimensional indices of `A` in tandem. As such, not all index types are guaranteed to propagate to `Base.to_index`.
```
touch(path::AbstractString)
```

Update the last-modified timestamp on a file to the current time.

If the file does not exist a new file is created.

Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> write("my_little_file", 2);

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.5273815391135583e9

julia> touch("my_little_file");

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.527381559163435e9
```

We can see the [`mtime`](@ref) has been modified by `touch`.
```
trailing_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_ones(3)
2
```
```
trailing_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_zeros(2)
1
```
```
transcode(T, src)
```

Convert string data between Unicode encodings. `src` is either a `String` or a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-XX code units, where `XX` is 8, 16, or 32. `T` indicates the encoding of the return value: `String` to return a (UTF-8 encoded) `String` or `UIntXX` to return a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-`XX` data. (The alias [`Cwchar_t`](@ref) can also be used as the integer type, for converting `wchar_t*` strings used by external C libraries.)

The `transcode` function succeeds as long as the input data can be reasonably represented in the target encoding; it always succeeds for conversions between UTF-XX encodings, even for invalid Unicode data.

Only conversion to/from UTF-8 is currently supported.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγ"
"αβγ"

julia> transcode(UInt16, str)
3-element Vector{UInt16}:
 0x03b1
 0x03b2
 0x03b3

julia> transcode(String, transcode(UInt16, str))
"αβγ"
```
```
transpose(A)
```

Lazy transpose. Mutating the returned object should appropriately mutate `A`. Often, but not always, yields `Transpose(A)`, where `Transpose` is a lazy transpose wrapper. Note that this operation is recursive.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3+2im  8+7im
 9+2im  4+6im
```
```
trues(dims)
```

Create a `BitArray` with all values set to `true`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trues(2,3)
2×3 BitMatrix:
 1  1  1
 1  1  1
```
```
trunc([T,] x)
trunc(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
trunc(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`trunc(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`.

`trunc(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

See also: [`%`](@ref rem), [`floor`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`unsafe_trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(2.22)
2.0

julia> trunc(-2.22, digits=1)
-2.2

julia> trunc(Int, -2.22)
-2
```

```
trunc(dt::TimeType, ::Type{Period}) -> TimeType
```

Truncates the value of `dt` according to the provided `Period` type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(Dates.DateTime("1996-01-01T12:30:00"), Dates.Day)
1996-01-01T00:00:00
```
```
truncate(file, n)
```

Resize the file or buffer given by the first argument to exactly `n` bytes, filling previously unallocated space with '\0' if the file or buffer is grown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.")
35

julia> truncate(io, 15)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=15, maxsize=Inf, ptr=16, mark=-1)

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a "

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> truncate(io, 40);

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\0\0\0\0\0"
```
```
trylock(lock) -> Success (Boolean)
```

Acquire the lock if it is available, and return `true` if successful. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, return `false`.

Each successful `trylock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).
```
tryparse(type, str; base)
```

Like [`parse`](@ref), but returns either a value of the requested type, or [`nothing`](@ref) if the string does not contain a valid number.
```
typeintersect(T::Type, S::Type)
```

Compute a type that contains the intersection of `T` and `S`. Usually this will be the smallest such type or one close to it.
```
typejoin(T, S)
```

Return the closest common ancestor of `T` and `S`, i.e. the narrowest type from which they both inherit.
```
typemax(T)
```

The highest value representable by the given (real) numeric `DataType`.

See also: [`floatmax`](@ref), [`typemin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemax(Int8)
127

julia> typemax(UInt32)
0xffffffff

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf

julia> floatmax(Float32)  # largest finite floating point number
3.4028235f38
```
```
typemin(T)
```

The lowest value representable by the given (real) numeric DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemin(Float16)
-Inf16

julia> typemin(Float32)
-Inf32
```
```
unescape_string(str::AbstractString, keep = ())::AbstractString
unescape_string(io, s::AbstractString, keep = ())::Nothing
```

General unescaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`. The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which (along with backlashes) are to be kept as they are.

The following escape sequences are recognised:

  * Escaped backslash (`\\`)
  * Escaped double-quote (`\"`)
  * Standard C escape sequences (`\a`, `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\v`, `\f`, `\r`, `\e`)
  * Unicode BMP code points (`\u` with 1-4 trailing hex digits)
  * All Unicode code points (`\U` with 1-8 trailing hex digits; max value = 0010ffff)
  * Hex bytes (`\x` with 1-2 trailing hex digits)
  * Octal bytes (`\` with 1-3 trailing octal digits)

See also [`escape_string`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unescape_string("aaa\\nbbb") # C escape sequence
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> unescape_string("\\u03c0") # unicode
"π"

julia> unescape_string("\\101") # octal
"A"

julia> unescape_string("aaa \\g \\n", ['g']) # using `keep` argument
"aaa \\g \n"
```
```
union(s, itrs...)
∪(s, itrs...)
```

Construct an object containing all distinct elements from all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∪` can be typed by writing `\cup` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∪ itr`.

See also [`unique`](@ref), [`intersect`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`Iterators.flatten`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> union([1, 2], [3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> union([4 2 3 4 4], 1:3, 3.0)
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 4.0
 2.0
 3.0
 1.0

julia> (0, 0.0) ∪ (-0.0, NaN)
3-element Vector{Real}:
   0
  -0.0
 NaN

julia> union(Set([1, 2]), 2:3)
Set{Int64} with 3 elements:
  2
  3
  1
```
```
union!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the [`union`](@ref) of passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([3, 4, 5]);

julia> union!(a, 1:2:7);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 5 elements:
  5
  4
  7
  3
  1
```
```
unique(itr)
```

Return an array containing only the unique elements of collection `itr`, as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), in the order that the first of each set of equivalent elements originally appears. The element type of the input is preserved.

See also: [`unique!`](@ref), [`allunique`](@ref), [`allequal`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique([1, 2, 6, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> unique(Real[1, 1.0, 2])
2-element Vector{Real}:
 1
 2
```

```
unique(f, itr)
```

Returns an array containing one value from `itr` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `itr`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4
```

```
unique(A::AbstractArray; dims::Int)
```

Return unique regions of `A` along dimension `dims`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = map(isodd, reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2)))
2×2×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0

[:, :, 2] =
 1  1
 0  0

julia> unique(A)
2-element Vector{Bool}:
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=2)
2×1×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1
 0

[:, :, 2] =
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=3)
2×2×1 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0
```
```
unique!(f, A::AbstractVector)
```

Selects one value from `A` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `A`, then return the modified A.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method is available as of Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4

julia> unique!(n -> n%3, [5, 1, 8, 9, 3, 4, 10, 7, 2, 6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 1
 9

julia> unique!(iseven, [2, 3, 5, 7, 9])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```

```
unique!(A::AbstractVector)
```

Remove duplicate items as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), then return the modified `A`. `unique!` will return the elements of `A` in the order that they occur. If you do not care about the order of the returned data, then calling `(sort!(A); unique!(A))` will be much more efficient as long as the elements of `A` can be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!([1, 1, 1])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

julia> A = [7, 3, 2, 3, 7, 5];

julia> unique!(A)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 7
 3
 2
 5

julia> B = [7, 6, 42, 6, 7, 42];

julia> sort!(B);  # unique! is able to process sorted data much more efficiently.

julia> unique!(B)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  6
  7
 42
```
```
unlock(lock)
```

Releases ownership of the `lock`.

If this is a recursive lock which has been acquired before, decrement an internal counter and return immediately.
```
unmark(s::IO)
```

Remove a mark from stream `s`. Return `true` if the stream was marked, `false` otherwise.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers `dest` and `src` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source array to a destination, starting at offset `so` in the source and `do` in the destination (1-indexed).

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed to ensure that N is inbounds on either array. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, i::Integer=1)
```

Load a value of type `T` from the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1]`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may segfault your program or return garbage answers, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_pointer_to_objref(p::Ptr)
```

Convert a `Ptr` to an object reference. Assumes the pointer refers to a valid heap-allocated Julia object. If this is not the case, undefined behavior results, hence this function is considered "unsafe" and should be used with care.

See also [`pointer_from_objref`](@ref).
```
unsafe_read(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from the `IO` stream object into `ref` (converted to a pointer).

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_read(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsafe_store!(p::Ptr{T}, x, i::Integer=1)
```

Store a value of type `T` to the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1] = x`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_string(p::Ptr{UInt8}, [length::Integer])
```

Copy a string from the address of a C-style (NUL-terminated) string encoded as UTF-8. (The pointer can be safely freed afterwards.) If `length` is specified (the length of the data in bytes), the string does not have to be NUL-terminated.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `p` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_trunc(T, x)
```

Return the nearest integral value of type `T` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`. If the value is not representable by `T`, an arbitrary value will be returned. See also [`trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, -2.2)
-2

julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, NaN)
-9223372036854775808
```
```
unsafe_wrap(Array, pointer::Ptr{T}, dims; own = false)
```

Wrap a Julia `Array` object around the data at the address given by `pointer`, without making a copy.  The pointer element type `T` determines the array element type. `dims` is either an integer (for a 1d array) or a tuple of the array dimensions. `own` optionally specifies whether Julia should take ownership of the memory, calling `free` on the pointer when the array is no longer referenced.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `pointer` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_write(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from `ref` (converted to a pointer) into the `IO` object.

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_write(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsigned(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the unsigned type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(Int16)
UInt16
julia> unsigned(UInt64)
UInt64
```

```
unsigned(x)
```

Convert a number to an unsigned integer. If the argument is signed, it is reinterpreted as unsigned without checking for negative values.

See also: [`signed`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(-2)
0xfffffffffffffffe

julia> unsigned(2)
0x0000000000000002

julia> signed(unsigned(-2))
-2
```
```
uperm(file)
```

Get the permissions of the owner of the file as a bitfield of

| Value | Description        |
|:----- |:------------------ |
| 01    | Execute Permission |
| 02    | Write Permission   |
| 04    | Read Permission    |

For allowed arguments, see [`stat`](@ref).
```
uppercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to uppercase.

See also [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercase("Julia")
"JULIA"
```
```
uppercasefirst(s::AbstractString) -> String
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to uppercase (technically "title case" for Unicode). See also [`titlecase`](@ref) to capitalize the first character of every word in `s`.

See also [`lowercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercasefirst("python")
"Python"
```
```
valtype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
valtype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the value type of an array. This is identical to `eltype` and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(["one", "two", "three"])
String
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
valtype(type)
```

Get the value type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
String
```
```
values(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values, return an iterator over the values. This function simply returns its argument by default, since the elements of a general iterator are normally considered its "values".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2);

julia> values(d)
ValueIterator for a Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  2
  1

julia> values([2])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
```

```
values(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all values in a collection. `collect(values(a))` returns an array of values. When the values are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(values(D))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```
```
vcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 1. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(vcat, x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3 4 5]
1×5 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4  5

julia> b = [6 7 8 9 10; 11 12 13 14 15]
2×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> vcat(a,b)
3×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  1   2   3   4   5
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> c = ([1 2 3], [4 5 6])
([1 2 3], [4 5 6])

julia> vcat(c...)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vs = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
 [5, 6]

julia> reduce(vcat, vs)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
vec(a::AbstractArray) -> AbstractVector
```

Reshape the array `a` as a one-dimensional column vector. Return `a` if it is already an `AbstractVector`. The resulting array shares the same underlying data as `a`, so it will only be mutable if `a` is mutable, in which case modifying one will also modify the other.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vec(a)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 2
 5
 3
 6

julia> vec(1:3)
1:3
```

See also [`reshape`](@ref), [`dropdims`](@ref).
```
view(A, inds...)
```

Like [`getindex`](@ref), but returns a lightweight array that lazily references (or is effectively a *view* into) the parent array `A` at the given index or indices `inds` instead of eagerly extracting elements or constructing a copied subset. Calling [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) on the returned value (often a [`SubArray`](@ref)) computes the indices to access or modify the parent array on the fly.  The behavior is undefined if the shape of the parent array is changed after `view` is called because there is no bound check for the parent array; e.g., it may cause a segmentation fault.

Some immutable parent arrays (like ranges) may choose to simply recompute a new array in some circumstances instead of returning a `SubArray` if doing so is efficient and provides compatible semantics.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    In Julia 1.6 or later, `view` can be called on an `AbstractString`, returning a `SubString`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = view(A, :, 1)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A # Note A has changed even though we modified b
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4

julia> view(2:5, 2:3) # returns a range as type is immutable
3:4
```
```
wait([x])
```

Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

  * [`Channel`](@ref): Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
  * [`Condition`](@ref): Wait for [`notify`](@ref) on a condition and return the `val` parameter passed to `notify`.
  * `Process`: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The `exitcode` field of a process can be used to determine success or failure.
  * [`Task`](@ref): Wait for a `Task` to finish. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.
  * [`RawFD`](@ref): Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see the `FileWatching` package).

If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. A task can only be restarted by an explicit call to [`schedule`](@ref) or [`yieldto`](@ref).

Often `wait` is called within a `while` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before proceeding.

Special note for [`Threads.Condition`](@ref):

The caller must be holding the [`lock`](@ref) that owns a `Threads.Condition` before calling this method. The calling task will be blocked until some other task wakes it, usually by calling [`notify`](@ref) on the same `Threads.Condition` object. The lock will be atomically released when blocking (even if it was locked recursively), and will be reacquired before returning.

```
wait(r::Future)
```

Wait for a value to become available for the specified [`Future`](@ref).

```
wait(r::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Wait for a value to become available on the specified [`RemoteChannel`](@ref).
```
walkdir(dir; topdown=true, follow_symlinks=false, onerror=throw)
```

Return an iterator that walks the directory tree of a directory. The iterator returns a tuple containing `(rootpath, dirs, files)`. The directory tree can be traversed top-down or bottom-up. If `walkdir` or `stat` encounters a `IOError` it will rethrow the error by default. A custom error handling function can be provided through `onerror` keyword argument. `onerror` is called with a `IOError` as argument.

# Examples

```julia
for (root, dirs, files) in walkdir(".")
    println("Directories in $root")
    for dir in dirs
        println(joinpath(root, dir)) # path to directories
    end
    println("Files in $root")
    for file in files
        println(joinpath(root, file)) # path to files
    end
end
```

```julia-repl
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> itr = walkdir("my");

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my", ["test"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test", ["dir"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test/dir", String[], String[])
```
```
which(f, types)
```

Returns the method of `f` (a `Method` object) that would be called for arguments of the given `types`.

If `types` is an abstract type, then the method that would be called by `invoke` is returned.

See also: [`parentmodule`](@ref), and `@which` and `@edit` in [`InteractiveUtils`](@ref man-interactive-utils).

```
which(types::Type{<:Tuple})
```

Returns the method that would be called by the given type signature (as a tuple type).

```
which(module, symbol)
```

Return the module in which the binding for the variable referenced by `symbol` in `module` was created.
```
widemul(x, y)
```

Multiply `x` and `y`, giving the result as a larger type.

See also [`promote`](@ref), [`Base.add_sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widemul(Float32(3.0), 4.0) isa BigFloat
true

julia> typemax(Int8) * typemax(Int8)
1

julia> widemul(typemax(Int8), typemax(Int8))  # == 127^2
16129
```
```
widen(x)
```

If `x` is a type, return a "larger" type, defined so that arithmetic operations `+` and `-` are guaranteed not to overflow nor lose precision for any combination of values that type `x` can hold.

For fixed-size integer types less than 128 bits, `widen` will return a type with twice the number of bits.

If `x` is a value, it is converted to `widen(typeof(x))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widen(Int32)
Int64

julia> widen(1.5f0)
1.5
```
```
withenv(f, kv::Pair...)
```

Execute `f` in an environment that is temporarily modified (not replaced as in `setenv`) by zero or more `"var"=>val` arguments `kv`. `withenv` is generally used via the `withenv(kv...) do ... end` syntax. A value of `nothing` can be used to temporarily unset an environment variable (if it is set). When `withenv` returns, the original environment has been restored.
```
write(io::IO, x)
write(filename::AbstractString, x)
```

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given I/O stream or file. Return the number of bytes written into the stream. See also [`print`](@ref) to write a text representation (with an encoding that may depend upon `io`).

The endianness of the written value depends on the endianness of the host system. Convert to/from a fixed endianness when writing/reading (e.g. using  [`htol`](@ref) and [`ltoh`](@ref)) to get results that are consistent across platforms.

You can write multiple values with the same `write` call. i.e. the following are equivalent:

```
write(io, x, y...)
write(io, x) + write(io, y...)
```

# Examples

Consistent serialization:

```jldoctest
julia> fname = tempname(); # random temporary filename

julia> open(fname,"w") do f
           # Make sure we write 64bit integer in little-endian byte order
           write(f,htol(Int64(42)))
       end
8

julia> open(fname,"r") do f
           # Convert back to host byte order and host integer type
           Int(ltoh(read(f,Int64)))
       end
42
```

Merging write calls:

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."

julia> write(io, "Sometimes those members") + write(io, " write documentation.")
44

julia> String(take!(io))
"Sometimes those members write documentation."
```

User-defined plain-data types without `write` methods can be written when wrapped in a `Ref`:

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct; x::Float64; end

julia> io = IOBuffer()
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=0, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> write(io, Ref(MyStruct(42.0)))
8

julia> seekstart(io); read!(io, Ref(MyStruct(NaN)))
Base.RefValue{MyStruct}(MyStruct(42.0))
```
```
xor(x, y)
⊻(x, y)
```

Bitwise exclusive or of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊻ b` is a synonym for `xor(a,b)`, and `⊻` can be typed by tab-completing `\xor` or `\veebar` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> xor(true, false)
true

julia> xor(true, true)
false

julia> xor(true, missing)
missing

julia> false ⊻ false
false

julia> [true; true; false] .⊻ [true; false; false]
3-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
```
```
yield()
```

Switch to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run. A task that calls this function is still runnable, and will be restarted immediately if there are no other runnable tasks.

```
yield(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

A fast, unfair-scheduling version of `schedule(t, arg); yield()` which immediately yields to `t` before calling the scheduler.
```
yieldto(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with no arguments. On subsequent switches, `arg` is returned from the task's last call to `yieldto`. This is a low-level call that only switches tasks, not considering states or scheduling in any way. Its use is discouraged.
```
zero(x)
zero(::Type)
```

Get the additive identity element for the type of `x` (`x` can also specify the type itself).

See also [`iszero`](@ref), [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zero(1)
0

julia> zero(big"2.0")
0.0

julia> zero(rand(2,2))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0
```
```
zeros([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
zeros([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all zeros with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`ones`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zeros(1)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0

julia> zeros(Int8, 2, 3)
2×3 Matrix{Int8}:
 0  0  0
 0  0  0
```
```
zip(iters...)
```

Run multiple iterators at the same time, until any of them is exhausted. The value type of the `zip` iterator is a tuple of values of its subiterators.

!!! note
    `zip` orders the calls to its subiterators in such a way that stateful iterators will not advance when another iterator finishes in the current iteration.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:5
1:5

julia> b = ["e","d","b","c","a"]
5-element Vector{String}:
 "e"
 "d"
 "b"
 "c"
 "a"

julia> c = zip(a,b)
zip(1:5, ["e", "d", "b", "c", "a"])

julia> length(c)
5

julia> first(c)
(1, "e")
```
```
x | y
```

Bitwise or. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `false`.

See also: [`&`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`||`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 | 10
14

julia> 4 | 1
5

julia> true | missing
true

julia> false | missing
missing
```
```
|>(x, f)
```

Applies a function to the preceding argument. This allows for easy function chaining.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1:5;] |> (x->x.^2) |> sum |> inv
0.01818181818181818
```
```
~(x)
```

Bitwise not.

julia> ~4
-5

julia> ~10
-11

julia> ~true

```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

See also: [`cld`](@ref), [`fld`](@ref), [`rem`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 9 ÷ 4
2

julia> -5 ÷ 3

julia> 5.0 ÷ 2
2.0

julia> div.(-5:5, 3)'

 -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> div(4, 3, RoundDown) # Matches fld(4, 3)
1
julia> div(4, 3, RoundUp) # Matches cld(4, 3)

```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

julia> 4 in a
true

julia> 5 in a
false

julia> missing in [1, 2]

```
sqrt(x)
```

Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.

See also: [`hypot`](@ref).

# Examples

```
sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

If `A` is real-symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root.   For such matrices, eigenvalues λ that appear to be slightly negative due to roundoff errors are treated as if they were zero. More precisely, matrices with all eigenvalues `≥ -rtol*(max |λ|)` are treated as semidefinite (yielding a Hermitian square root), with negative eigenvalues taken to be zero. `rtol` is a keyword argument to `sqrt` (in the Hermitian/real-symmetric case only) that defaults to machine precision scaled by `size(A,1)`.

Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor. If a real square root exists, then an extension of this method [^H87] that computes the real Schur form and then the real square root of the quasi-triangular factor is instead used.

cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"

```
union(s, itrs...)
∪(s, itrs...)
```

Construct an object containing all distinct elements from all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∪` can be typed by writing `\cup` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∪ itr`.

```
!=(x, y)
≠(x,y)
```

Not-equals comparison operator. Always gives the opposite answer as [`==`](@ref).

# Implementation

New types should generally not implement this, and rely on the fallback definition `!=(x,y) = !(x==y)` instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 != 2
true

julia> "foo" ≠ "foo"
false
```

```
!=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`!=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y != x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(!=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
!==(x, y)
≢(x,y)
```

Always gives the opposite answer as [`===`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2];

julia> a ≢ b
true

julia> a ≢ a
false
```
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
x & y
```

Bitwise and. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `true`. Add parentheses for function application form: `(&)(x, y)`.

See also: [`|`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`&&`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 & 10
0

julia> 4 & 12
4

julia> true & missing
missing

julia> false & missing
false
```
```
A'
adjoint(A)
```

Lazy adjoint (conjugate transposition). Note that `adjoint` is applied recursively to elements.

For number types, `adjoint` returns the complex conjugate, and therefore it is equivalent to the identity function for real numbers.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> adjoint(A)
2×2 adjoint(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3-2im  8-7im
 9-2im  4-6im

julia> x = [3, 4im]
2-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 3 + 0im
 0 + 4im

julia> x'x
25 + 0im
```
```
*(s::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, t::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}...) -> AbstractString
```

Concatenate strings and/or characters, producing a [`String`](@ref). This is equivalent to calling the [`string`](@ref) function on the arguments. Concatenation of built-in string types always produces a value of type `String` but other string types may choose to return a string of a different type as appropriate.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "Hello " * "world"
"Hello world"

julia> 'j' * "ulia"
"julia"
```

```
*(s::Regex, t::Union{Regex,AbstractString,AbstractChar}) -> Regex
*(s::Union{Regex,AbstractString,AbstractChar}, t::Regex) -> Regex
```

Concatenate regexes, strings and/or characters, producing a [`Regex`](@ref). String and character arguments must be matched exactly in the resulting regex, meaning that the contained characters are devoid of any special meaning (they are quoted with "\Q" and "\E").

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"Hello|Good bye" * ' ' * "world", "Hello world")
RegexMatch("Hello world")

julia> r = r"a|b" * "c|d"
r"(?:a|b)\Qc|d\E"

julia> match(r, "ac") == nothing
true

julia> match(r, "ac|d")
RegexMatch("ac|d")
```

```
*(x, y...)
```

Multiplication operator. `x*y*z*...` calls this function with all arguments, i.e. `*(x, y, z, ...)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 2 * 7 * 8
112

julia> *(2, 7, 8)
112
```

```
*(A::AbstractMatrix, B::AbstractMatrix)
```

Matrix multiplication.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1 1; 0 1] * [1 0; 1 1]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 1  1
```

```
*(A, B::AbstractMatrix, C)
A * B * C * D
```

Chained multiplication of 3 or 4 matrices is done in the most efficient sequence, based on the sizes of the arrays. That is, the number of scalar multiplications needed for `(A * B) * C` (with 3 dense matrices) is compared to that for `A * (B * C)` to choose which of these to execute.

If the last factor is a vector, or the first a transposed vector, then it is efficient to deal with these first. In particular `x' * B * y` means `(x' * B) * y` for an ordinary column-major `B::Matrix`. Unlike `dot(x, B, y)`, this allocates an intermediate array.

If the first or last factor is a number, this will be fused with the matrix multiplication, using 5-arg [`mul!`](@ref).

See also [`muladd`](@ref), [`dot`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    These optimisations require at least Julia 1.7.

```
+(x, y...)
```

Addition operator. `x+y+z+...` calls this function with all arguments, i.e. `+(x, y, z, ...)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 1 + 20 + 4
25

julia> +(1, 20, 4)
25
```

```
dt::Date + t::Time -> DateTime
```

The addition of a `Date` with a `Time` produces a `DateTime`. The hour, minute, second, and millisecond parts of the `Time` are used along with the year, month, and day of the `Date` to create the new `DateTime`. Non-zero microseconds or nanoseconds in the `Time` type will result in an `InexactError` being thrown.
```
-(x)
```

Unary minus operator.

See also: [`abs`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> -1
-1

julia> -(2)
-2

julia> -[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1  -2
 -3  -4
```

```
-(x, y)
```

Subtraction operator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 2 - 3
-1

julia> -(2, 4.5)
-2.5
```
```
/(x, y)
```

Right division operator: multiplication of `x` by the inverse of `y` on the right. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 1/2
0.5

julia> 4/2
2.0

julia> 4.5/2
2.25
```

```
A / B
```

Matrix right-division: `A / B` is equivalent to `(B' \ A')'` where [`\`](@ref) is the left-division operator. For square matrices, the result `X` is such that `A == X*B`.

See also: [`rdiv!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Float64[1 4 5; 3 9 2]; B = Float64[1 4 2; 3 4 2; 8 7 1];

julia> X = A / B
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 -0.65   3.75  -1.2
  3.25  -2.75   1.0

julia> isapprox(A, X*B)
true

julia> isapprox(X, A*pinv(B))
true
```
```
//(num, den)
```

Divide two integers or rational numbers, giving a [`Rational`](@ref) result.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 // 5
3//5

julia> (3 // 5) // (2 // 1)
3//10
```
```
Colon()
```

Colons (:) are used to signify indexing entire objects or dimensions at once.

Very few operations are defined on Colons directly; instead they are converted by [`to_indices`](@ref) to an internal vector type (`Base.Slice`) to represent the collection of indices they span before being used.

The singleton instance of `Colon` is also a function used to construct ranges; see [`:`](@ref).
```
<(x, y)
```

Less-than comparison operator. Falls back to [`isless`](@ref). Because of the behavior of floating-point NaN values, this operator implements a partial order.

# Implementation

New numeric types with a canonical partial order should implement this function for two arguments of the new type. Types with a canonical total order should implement [`isless`](@ref) instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' < 'b'
true

julia> "abc" < "abd"
true

julia> 5 < 3
false
```

```
<(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y < x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
<:(T1, T2)
```

Subtype operator: returns `true` if and only if all values of type `T1` are also of type `T2`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Float64 <: AbstractFloat
true

julia> Vector{Int} <: AbstractArray
true

julia> Matrix{Float64} <: Matrix{AbstractFloat}
false
```
```
<<(x, n)
```

Left bit shift operator, `x << n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted left by `n` bits, filling with `0`s. This is equivalent to `x * 2^n`. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x >> -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(3) << 2
12

julia> bitstring(Int8(3))
"00000011"

julia> bitstring(Int8(12))
"00001100"
```

See also [`>>`](@ref), [`>>>`](@ref), [`exp2`](@ref), [`ldexp`](@ref).

```
<<(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Left bit shift operator, `B << n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `B` with elements shifted `n` positions backwards, filling with `false` values. If `n < 0`, elements are shifted forwards. Equivalent to `B >> -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> B = BitVector([true, false, true, false, false])
5-element BitVector:
 1
 0
 1
 0
 0

julia> B << 1
5-element BitVector:
 0

julia> B << -1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 1
 0
```
```
<=(x, y)
≤(x,y)
```

Less-than-or-equals comparison operator. Falls back to `(x < y) | (x == y)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' <= 'b'
true

julia> 7 ≤ 7 ≤ 9
true

julia> "abc" ≤ "abc"
true

julia> 5 <= 3
false
```

```
<=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y <= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
==(x, y)
```

Generic equality operator. Falls back to [`===`](@ref). Should be implemented for all types with a notion of equality, based on the abstract value that an instance represents. For example, all numeric types are compared by numeric value, ignoring type. Strings are compared as sequences of characters, ignoring encoding. For collections, `==` is generally called recursively on all contents, though other properties (like the shape for arrays) may also be taken into account.

This operator follows IEEE semantics for floating-point numbers: `0.0 == -0.0` and `NaN != NaN`.

The result is of type `Bool`, except when one of the operands is [`missing`](@ref), in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic)). For collections, `missing` is returned if at least one of the operands contains a `missing` value and all non-missing values are equal. Use [`isequal`](@ref) or [`===`](@ref) to always get a `Bool` result.

# Implementation

New numeric types should implement this function for two arguments of the new type, and handle comparison to other types via promotion rules where possible.

[`isequal`](@ref) falls back to `==`, so new methods of `==` will be used by the [`Dict`](@ref) type to compare keys. If your type will be used as a dictionary key, it should therefore also implement [`hash`](@ref).

If some type defines `==`, [`isequal`](@ref), and [`isless`](@ref) then it should also implement [`<`](@ref) to ensure consistency of comparisons.

```
==(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`==`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y == x`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(==)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
==(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether two strings are equal character by character (technically, Unicode code point by code point).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> "abc" == "abc"
true

julia> "abc" == "αβγ"
false
```
```
>(x, y)
```

Greater-than comparison operator. Falls back to `y < x`.

# Implementation

Generally, new types should implement [`<`](@ref) instead of this function, and rely on the fallback definition `>(x, y) = y < x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' > 'b'
false

julia> 7 > 3 > 1
true

julia> "abc" > "abd"
false

julia> 5 > 3
true
```

```
>(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`>`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y > x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(>)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
>:(T1, T2)
```

Supertype operator, equivalent to `T2 <: T1`.
```
>=(x, y)
≥(x,y)
```

Greater-than-or-equals comparison operator. Falls back to `y <= x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 'a' >= 'b'
false

julia> 7 ≥ 7 ≥ 3
true

julia> "abc" ≥ "abc"
true

julia> 5 >= 3
true
```

```
>=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`>=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y >= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(>=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
>>(x, n)
```

Right bit shift operator, `x >> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted right by `n` bits, where `n >= 0`, filling with `0`s if `x >= 0`, `1`s if `x < 0`, preserving the sign of `x`. This is equivalent to `fld(x, 2^n)`. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x << -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(13) >> 2
3

julia> bitstring(Int8(13))
"00001101"

julia> bitstring(Int8(3))
"00000011"

julia> Int8(-14) >> 2
-4

julia> bitstring(Int8(-14))
"11110010"

julia> bitstring(Int8(-4))
"11111100"
```

See also [`>>>`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

```
>>(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Right bit shift operator, `B >> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `B` with elements shifted `n` positions forward, filling with `false` values. If `n < 0`, elements are shifted backwards. Equivalent to `B << -n`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> B = BitVector([true, false, true, false, false])
5-element BitVector:
 1
 0
 1
 0
 0

julia> B >> 1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 1
 0

julia> B >> -1
5-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
 0
 0
```
```
>>>(x, n)
```

Unsigned right bit shift operator, `x >>> n`. For `n >= 0`, the result is `x` shifted right by `n` bits, where `n >= 0`, filling with `0`s. For `n < 0`, this is equivalent to `x << -n`.

For [`Unsigned`](@ref) integer types, this is equivalent to [`>>`](@ref). For [`Signed`](@ref) integer types, this is equivalent to `signed(unsigned(x) >> n)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> Int8(-14) >>> 2
60

julia> bitstring(Int8(-14))
"11110010"

julia> bitstring(Int8(60))
"00111100"
```

[`BigInt`](@ref)s are treated as if having infinite size, so no filling is required and this is equivalent to [`>>`](@ref).

See also [`>>`](@ref), [`<<`](@ref).

```
>>>(B::BitVector, n) -> BitVector
```

Unsigned right bitshift operator, `B >>> n`. Equivalent to `B >> n`. See [`>>`](@ref) for details and examples.
```
@MIME_str
```

A convenience macro for writing [`MIME`](@ref) types, typically used when adding methods to [`show`](@ref). For example the syntax `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/html", x::MyType) = ...` could be used to define how to write an HTML representation of `MyType`.
```
@NamedTuple{key1::Type1, key2::Type2, ...}
@NamedTuple begin key1::Type1; key2::Type2; ...; end
```

This macro gives a more convenient syntax for declaring `NamedTuple` types. It returns a `NamedTuple` type with the given keys and types, equivalent to `NamedTuple{(:key1, :key2, ...), Tuple{Type1,Type2,...}}`. If the `::Type` declaration is omitted, it is taken to be `Any`.   The `begin ... end` form allows the declarations to be split across multiple lines (similar to a `struct` declaration), but is otherwise equivalent.

For example, the tuple `(a=3.1, b="hello")` has a type `NamedTuple{(:a, :b),Tuple{Float64,String}}`, which can also be declared via `@NamedTuple` as:

```jldoctest
julia> @NamedTuple{a::Float64, b::String}
NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Float64, String}}

julia> @NamedTuple begin
           a::Float64
           b::String
       end
NamedTuple{(:a, :b), Tuple{Float64, String}}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.5.

```
@__DIR__ -> AbstractString
```

Expand to a string with the absolute path to the directory of the file containing the macrocall. Return the current working directory if run from a REPL or if evaluated by `julia -e <expr>`.
```
@__FILE__ -> AbstractString
```

Expand to a string with the path to the file containing the macrocall, or an empty string if evaluated by `julia -e <expr>`. Return `nothing` if the macro was missing parser source information. Alternatively see [`PROGRAM_FILE`](@ref).
```
@__LINE__ -> Int
```

Expand to the line number of the location of the macrocall. Return `0` if the line number could not be determined.
```
@__MODULE__ -> Module
```

Get the `Module` of the toplevel eval, which is the `Module` code is currently being read from.
```
@. expr
```

Convert every function call or operator in `expr` into a "dot call" (e.g. convert `f(x)` to `f.(x)`), and convert every assignment in `expr` to a "dot assignment" (e.g. convert `+=` to `.+=`).

If you want to *avoid* adding dots for selected function calls in `expr`, splice those function calls in with `$`.  For example, `@. sqrt(abs($sort(x)))` is equivalent to `sqrt.(abs.(sort(x)))` (no dot for `sort`).

(`@.` is equivalent to a call to `@__dot__`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1.0:3.0; y = similar(x);

julia> @. y = x + 3 * sin(x)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 3.5244129544236893

 3.4233600241796016
```
```
@allocated
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the total number of bytes allocated during evaluation of the expression.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@elapsed`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @allocated rand(10^6)
8000080
```
No documentation found.

Binding `@allocations` does not exist.
```
@assert cond [text]
```

Throw an [`AssertionError`](@ref) if `cond` is `false`. Preferred syntax for writing assertions. Message `text` is optionally displayed upon assertion failure.

!!! warning
    An assert might be disabled at various optimization levels. Assert should therefore only be used as a debugging tool and not used for authentication verification (e.g., verifying passwords), nor should side effects needed for the function to work correctly be used inside of asserts.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @assert iseven(3) "3 is an odd number!"
ERROR: AssertionError: 3 is an odd number!

julia> @assert isodd(3) "What even are numbers?"
```
```
@async
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) and add it to the local machine's scheduler queue.

Values can be interpolated into `@async` via `$`, which copies the value directly into the constructed underlying closure. This allows you to insert the *value* of a variable, isolating the asynchronous code from changes to the variable's value in the current task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Interpolating values via `$` is available as of Julia 1.4.

```
@atomic var
@atomic order ex
```

Mark `var` or `ex` as being performed atomically, if `ex` is a supported expression.

```
@atomic a.b.x = new
@atomic a.b.x += addend
@atomic :release a.b.x = new
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x += addend
```

Perform the store operation expressed on the right atomically and return the new value.

With `=`, this operation translates to a `setproperty!(a.b, :x, new)` call. With any operator also, this operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, +, addend)[2]` call.

```
@atomic a.b.x max arg2
@atomic a.b.x + arg2
@atomic max(a.b.x, arg2)
@atomic :acquire_release max(a.b.x, arg2)
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x + arg2
@atomic :acquire_release a.b.x max arg2
```

Perform the binary operation expressed on the right atomically. Store the result into the field in the first argument and return the values `(old, new)`.

This operation translates to a `modifyproperty!(a.b, :x, func, arg2)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

@atomicreplace a.b.x expected => desired
@atomicreplace :sequentially_consistent a.b.x expected => desired
@atomicreplace :sequentially_consistent :monotonic a.b.x expected => desired
```

Perform the conditional replacement expressed by the pair atomically, returning the values `(old, success::Bool)`. Where `success` indicates whether the replacement was completed.

This operation translates to a `replaceproperty!(a.b, :x, expected, desired)` call.

See [Per-field atomics](@ref man-atomics) section in the manual for more details.

@b_str
```

Create an immutable byte (`UInt8`) vector using string syntax.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = b"12\x01\x02"
4-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x31
 0x32
 0x01

```
```
@big_str str
@big_str(str)
```

Parse a string into a [`BigInt`](@ref) or [`BigFloat`](@ref), and throw an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid number. For integers `_` is allowed in the string as a separator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big"123_456"
123456

julia> big"7891.5"
7891.5
```
```
@boundscheck(blk)
```

Annotates the expression `blk` as a bounds checking block, allowing it to be elided by [`@inbounds`](@ref).

!!! note
    The function in which `@boundscheck` is written must be inlined into its caller in order for `@inbounds` to have effect.


# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> @inline function g(A, i)
           @boundscheck checkbounds(A, i)
           return "accessing ($A)[$i]"
       end;

julia> f1() = return g(1:2, -1);

julia> f2() = @inbounds return g(1:2, -1);

```

!!! warning
    The `@boundscheck` annotation allows you, as a library writer, to opt-in to allowing *other code* to remove your bounds checks with [`@inbounds`](@ref). As noted there, the caller must verify—using information they can access—that their accesses are valid before using `@inbounds`. For indexing into your [`AbstractArray`](@ref) subclasses, for example, this involves checking the indices against its [`axes`](@ref). Therefore, `@boundscheck` annotations should only be added to a [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) implementation after you are certain its behavior is correct.

```
@ccall library.function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall function_name(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
@ccall $function_pointer(argvalue1::argtype1, ...)::returntype
```

Call a function in a C-exported shared library, specified by `library.function_name`, where `library` is a string constant or literal. The library may be omitted, in which case the `function_name` is resolved in the current process. Alternatively, `@ccall` may also be used to call a function pointer `$function_pointer`, such as one returned by `dlsym`.

Each `argvalue` to `@ccall` is converted to the corresponding `argtype`, by automatic insertion of calls to `unsafe_convert(argtype, cconvert(argtype, argvalue))`. (See also the documentation for [`unsafe_convert`](@ref Base.unsafe_convert) and [`cconvert`](@ref Base.cconvert) for further details.) In most cases, this simply results in a call to `convert(argtype, argvalue)`.

# Examples

```
@ccall strlen(s::Cstring)::Csize_t
```

This calls the C standard library function:

```
size_t strlen(char *)
```

with a Julia variable named `s`. See also `ccall`.

Varargs are supported with the following convention:

```
@ccall printf("%s = %d"::Cstring ; "foo"::Cstring, foo::Cint)::Cint
```

The semicolon is used to separate required arguments (of which there must be at least one) from variadic arguments.

Example using an external library:

```
# C signature of g_uri_escape_string:
# char *g_uri_escape_string(const char *unescaped, const char *reserved_chars_allowed, gboolean allow_utf8);

const glib = "libglib-2.0"
@ccall glib.g_uri_escape_string(my_uri::Cstring, ":/"::Cstring, true::Cint)::Cstring
```

The string literal could also be used directly before the function name, if desired `"libglib-2.0".g_uri_escape_string(...`
```
@cfunction(callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> Ptr{Cvoid}
@cfunction($callable, ReturnType, (ArgumentTypes...,)) -> CFunction
```

Generate a C-callable function pointer from the Julia function `callable` for the given type signature. To pass the return value to a `ccall`, use the argument type `Ptr{Cvoid}` in the signature.

Note that the argument type tuple must be a literal tuple, and not a tuple-valued variable or expression (although it can include a splat expression). And that these arguments will be evaluated in global scope during compile-time (not deferred until runtime). Adding a '$' in front of the function argument changes this to instead create a runtime closure over the local variable `callable` (this is not supported on all architectures).

See [manual section on ccall and cfunction usage](@ref Calling-C-and-Fortran-Code).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> function foo(x::Int, y::Int)
           return x + y
       end

julia> @cfunction(foo, Int, (Int, Int))
Ptr{Cvoid} @0x000000001b82fcd0
```
```
@cmd str
```

Similar to `cmd`, generate a `Cmd` from the `str` string which represents the shell command(s) to be executed. The [`Cmd`](@ref) object can be run as a process and can outlive the spawning julia process (see `Cmd` for more).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cm = @cmd " echo 1 "
`echo 1`

julia> run(cm)
1
Process(`echo 1`, ProcessExited(0))
```
```
@coalesce(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); missing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @coalesce a f(2) f(3) error("`a` is still missing")
1

julia> b = missing;

julia> b = @coalesce b f(2) f(3) error("`b` is still missing")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: `b` is still missing

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@deprecate old new [export_old=true]
```

Deprecate method `old` and specify the replacement call `new`. Prevent `@deprecate` from exporting `old` by setting `export_old` to `false`. `@deprecate` defines a new method with the same signature as `old`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    As of Julia 1.5, functions defined by `@deprecate` do not print warning when `julia` is run without the `--depwarn=yes` flag set, as the default value of `--depwarn` option is `no`.  The warnings are printed from tests run by `Pkg.test()`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x)
old (generic function with 1 method)

julia> @deprecate old(x) new(x) false
old (generic function with 1 method)
```
# Documentation

Functions, methods and types can be documented by placing a string before the definition:

```
"""
# The Foo Function
`foo(x)`: Foo the living hell out of `x`.
"""
foo(x) = ...
```

The `@doc` macro can be used directly to both set and retrieve documentation / metadata. The macro has special parsing so that the documented object may occur on the next line:

```
@doc "blah"
function foo() ...
```

By default, documentation is written as Markdown, but any object can be used as the first argument.

## Documenting objects after they are defined

You can document an object after its definition by

```
@doc "foo" function_to_doc
@doc "bar" TypeToDoc
```

For macros, the syntax is `@doc "macro doc" :(@Module.macro)` or `@doc "macro doc" :(string_macro"")` for string macros. Without the quote `:()` the expansion of the macro will be documented.

## Retrieving Documentation

You can retrieve docs for functions, macros and other objects as follows:

```
@doc foo
@doc @time
@doc md""
```

## Functions & Methods

Placing documentation before a method definition (e.g. `function foo() ...` or `foo() = ...`) will cause that specific method to be documented, as opposed to the whole function. Method docs are concatenated together in the order they were defined to provide docs for the function.
```
@elapsed
```

A macro to evaluate an expression, discarding the resulting value, instead returning the number of seconds it took to execute as a floating-point number.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@elapsed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@elapsed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @elapsed sleep(0.3)
0.301391426
```
```
@enum EnumName[::BaseType] value1[=x] value2[=y]
```

Create an `Enum{BaseType}` subtype with name `EnumName` and enum member values of `value1` and `value2` with optional assigned values of `x` and `y`, respectively. `EnumName` can be used just like other types and enum member values as regular values, such as

# Examples

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> @enum Fruit apple=1 orange=2 kiwi=3

julia> f(x::Fruit) = "I'm a Fruit with value: $(Int(x))"
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(apple)
"I'm a Fruit with value: 1"

julia> Fruit(1)
apple::Fruit = 1
```

Values can also be specified inside a `begin` block, e.g.

```julia
@enum EnumName begin
    value1
    value2
end
```

`BaseType`, which defaults to [`Int32`](@ref), must be a primitive subtype of `Integer`. Member values can be converted between the enum type and `BaseType`. `read` and `write` perform these conversions automatically. In case the enum is created with a non-default `BaseType`, `Integer(value1)` will return the integer `value1` with the type `BaseType`.

To list all the instances of an enum use `instances`, e.g.

```jldoctest fruitenum
julia> instances(Fruit)
(apple, orange, kiwi)
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000

    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@eval [mod,] ex
```

Evaluate an expression with values interpolated into it using `eval`. If two arguments are provided, the first is the module to evaluate in.
```
@evalpoly(z, c...)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k z^{k-1} c[k]$ for the coefficients `c[1]`, `c[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `z`.  This macro expands to efficient inline code that uses either Horner's method or, for complex `z`, a more efficient Goertzel-like algorithm.

See also [`evalpoly`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @evalpoly(3, 1, 0, 1)
10

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 0, 1)
5

julia> @evalpoly(2, 1, 1, 1)
7
```
```
@fastmath expr
```

Execute a transformed version of the expression, which calls functions that may violate strict IEEE semantics. This allows the fastest possible operation, but results are undefined – be careful when doing this, as it may change numerical results.

This sets the [LLVM Fast-Math flags](http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#fast-math-flags), and corresponds to the `-ffast-math` option in clang. See [the notes on performance annotations](@ref man-performance-annotations) for more details.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> @fastmath 1+2
3

julia> @fastmath(sin(3))
0.1411200080598672
```
```
@generated f
```

`@generated` is used to annotate a function which will be generated. In the body of the generated function, only types of arguments can be read (not the values). The function returns a quoted expression evaluated when the function is called. The `@generated` macro should not be used on functions mutating the global scope or depending on mutable elements.

See [Metaprogramming](@ref) for further details.

## Example:

```jldoctest
julia> @generated function bar(x)
           if x <: Integer
               return :(x ^ 2)
           else
               return :(x)
           end
       end
bar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> bar(4)
16

julia> bar("baz")
"baz"
```
```
@gensym
```

Generates a gensym symbol for a variable. For example, `@gensym x y` is transformed into `x = gensym("x"); y = gensym("y")`.
```
@goto name
```

`@goto name` unconditionally jumps to the statement at the location [`@label name`](@ref).

`@label` and `@goto` cannot create jumps to different top-level statements. Attempts cause an error. To still use `@goto`, enclose the `@label` and `@goto` in a block.
```
@html_str -> Docs.HTML
```

Create an `HTML` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> html"Julia"
HTML{String}("Julia")
```
```
@inbounds(blk)
```

Eliminates array bounds checking within expressions.

In the example below the in-range check for referencing element `i` of array `A` is skipped to improve performance.

```julia
function sum(A::AbstractArray)
    r = zero(eltype(A))
    for i in eachindex(A)
        @inbounds r += A[i]
    end
    return r
end
```

!!! warning
    Using `@inbounds` may return incorrect results/crashes/corruption for out-of-bounds indices. The user is responsible for checking it manually. Only use `@inbounds` when it is certain from the information locally available that all accesses are in bounds.

```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
@inline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that this function is worth inlining.

Small functions typically do not need the `@inline` annotation, as the compiler does it automatically. By using `@inline` on bigger functions, an extra nudge can be given to the compiler to inline it.

`@inline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@inline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@inline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @inline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@inline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that calls within `block` are worth inlining.

```julia
# The compiler will try to inline `f`
@inline f(...)

# The compiler will try to inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@inline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @noinline function explicit_noinline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @inline explicit_noinline(args...) # will be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @noinline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @inline f(a0)  # the compiler will try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)          # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! warning
    Although a callsite annotation will try to force inlining in regardless of the cost model, there are still chances it can't succeed in it. Especially, recursive calls can not be inlined even if they are annotated as `@inline`d.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.

lazy"str"
```

Create a [`LazyString`](@ref) using regular string interpolation syntax. Note that interpolations are *evaluated* at LazyString construction time, but *printing* is delayed until the first access to the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    `lazy"str"` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

```
@lock l expr
```

Macro version of `lock(f, l::AbstractLock)` but with `expr` instead of `f` function. Expands to:

```julia
lock(l)
try
    expr
finally
    unlock(l)
end
```

This is similar to using [`lock`](@ref) with a `do` block, but avoids creating a closure and thus can improve the performance.
```
@macroexpand
```

Return equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded).

There are differences between `@macroexpand` and [`macroexpand`](@ref).

  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) takes a keyword argument `recursive`, `@macroexpand` is always recursive. For a non recursive macro version, see [`@macroexpand1`](@ref).
  * While [`macroexpand`](@ref) has an explicit `module` argument, `@macroexpand` always expands with respect to the module in which it is called.

This is best seen in the following example:

```julia-repl
julia> module M
           macro m()
               1
           end
           function f()
               (@macroexpand(@m),
                macroexpand(M, :(@m)),
                macroexpand(Main, :(@m))
               )
           end
       end
M

julia> macro m()
           2
       end
@m (macro with 1 method)

julia> M.f()
(1, 1, 2)
```

With `@macroexpand` the expression expands where `@macroexpand` appears in the code (module `M` in the example). With `macroexpand` the expression expands in the module given as the first argument.
```
@macroexpand1
```

Non recursive version of [`@macroexpand`](@ref).
```
@noinline
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline a function.

Small functions are typically inlined automatically. By using `@noinline` on small functions, auto-inlining can be prevented.

`@noinline` can be applied immediately before the definition or in its function body.

```julia
# annotate long-form definition
@noinline function longdef(x)
    ...
end

# annotate short-form definition
@noinline shortdef(x) = ...

# annotate anonymous function that a `do` block creates
f() do
    @noinline
    ...
end
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The usage within a function body requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

```
@noinline block
```

Give a hint to the compiler that it should not inline the calls within `block`.

```julia
# The compiler will try to not inline `f`
@noinline f(...)

# The compiler will try to not inline `f`, `g` and `+`
@noinline f(...) + g(...)
```

!!! note
    A callsite annotation always has the precedence over the annotation applied to the definition of the called function:

    ```julia
    @inline function explicit_inline(args...)
        # body
    end

    let
        @noinline explicit_inline(args...) # will not be inlined
    end
    ```


!!! note
    When there are nested callsite annotations, the innermost annotation has the precedence:

    ```julia
    @inline let a0, b0 = ...
        a = @noinline f(a0)  # the compiler will NOT try to inline this call
        b = f(b0)            # the compiler will try to inline this call
        return a, b
    end
    ```


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The callsite annotation requires at least Julia 1.8.


---

!!! note
    If the function is trivial (for example returning a constant) it might get inlined anyway.

```
@nospecialize
```

Applied to a function argument name, hints to the compiler that the method should not be specialized for different types of that argument, but instead to use precisely the declared type for each argument. This is only a hint for avoiding excess code generation. Can be applied to an argument within a formal argument list, or in the function body. When applied to an argument, the macro must wrap the entire argument expression. When used in a function body, the macro must occur in statement position and before any code.

When used without arguments, it applies to all arguments of the parent scope. In local scope, this means all arguments of the containing function. In global (top-level) scope, this means all methods subsequently defined in the current module.

Specialization can reset back to the default by using [`@specialize`](@ref).

```julia
function example_function(@nospecialize x)
    ...
end

function example_function(x, @nospecialize(y = 1))
    ...
end

function example_function(x, y, z)
    @nospecialize x y
    ...
end

@nospecialize
f(y) = [x for x in y]
@specialize
```
```
@polly
```

Tells the compiler to apply the polyhedral optimizer Polly to a function.
```
@r_str -> Regex
```

Construct a regex, such as `r"^[a-z]*$"`, without interpolation and unescaping (except for quotation mark `"` which still has to be escaped). The regex also accepts one or more flags, listed after the ending quote, to change its behaviour:

  * `i` enables case-insensitive matching
  * `m` treats the `^` and `$` tokens as matching the start and end of individual lines, as opposed to the whole string.
  * `s` allows the `.` modifier to match newlines.
  * `x` enables "comment mode": whitespace is enabled except when escaped with `\`, and `#` is treated as starting a comment.
  * `a` disables `UCP` mode (enables ASCII mode). By default `\B`, `\b`, `\D`, `\d`, `\S`, `\s`, `\W`, `\w`, etc. match based on Unicode character properties. With this option, these sequences only match ASCII characters.

See [`Regex`](@ref) if interpolation is needed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> match(r"a+.*b+.*?d$"ism, "Goodbye,\nOh, angry,\nBad world\n")
RegexMatch("angry,\nBad world")
```

This regex has the first three flags enabled.
```
@raw_str -> String
```

Create a raw string without interpolation and unescaping. The exception is that quotation marks still must be escaped. Backslashes escape both quotation marks and other backslashes, but only when a sequence of backslashes precedes a quote character. Thus, 2n backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes and the end of the literal while 2n+1 backslashes followed by a quote encodes n backslashes followed by a quote character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println(raw"\ $x")
\ $x

julia> println(raw"\"")
"

julia> println(raw"\\\"")
\"

julia> println(raw"\\x \\\"")
\\x \"
```
```
@s_str -> SubstitutionString
```

Construct a substitution string, used for regular expression substitutions.  Within the string, sequences of the form `\N` refer to the Nth capture group in the regex, and `\g<groupname>` refers to a named capture group with name `groupname`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> msg = "#Hello# from Julia";

julia> replace(msg, r"#(.+)# from (?<from>\w+)" => s"FROM: \g<from>; MESSAGE: \1")
"FROM: Julia; MESSAGE: Hello"
```
```
@show exs...
```

Prints one or more expressions, and their results, to `stdout`, and returns the last result.

See also: [`show`](@ref), [`@info`](@ref man-logging), [`println`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = @show 1+2
1 + 2 = 3
3

julia> @show x^2 x/2;
x ^ 2 = 9
x / 2 = 1.5
```
```
@showtime expr
```

Like `@time` but also prints the expression being evaluated for reference.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This macro was added in Julia 1.8.


See also [`@time`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> @showtime sleep(1)
sleep(1): 1.002164 seconds (4 allocations: 128 bytes)
```
```
@simd
```

Annotate a `for` loop to allow the compiler to take extra liberties to allow loop re-ordering

!!! warning
    This feature is experimental and could change or disappear in future versions of Julia. Incorrect use of the `@simd` macro may cause unexpected results.


The object iterated over in a `@simd for` loop should be a one-dimensional range. By using `@simd`, you are asserting several properties of the loop:

  * It is safe to execute iterations in arbitrary or overlapping order, with special consideration for reduction variables.
  * Floating-point operations on reduction variables can be reordered, possibly causing different results than without `@simd`.

In many cases, Julia is able to automatically vectorize inner for loops without the use of `@simd`. Using `@simd` gives the compiler a little extra leeway to make it possible in more situations. In either case, your inner loop should have the following properties to allow vectorization:

  * The loop must be an innermost loop
  * The loop body must be straight-line code. Therefore, [`@inbounds`](@ref) is   currently needed for all array accesses. The compiler can sometimes turn   short `&&`, `||`, and `?:` expressions into straight-line code if it is safe   to evaluate all operands unconditionally. Consider using the [`ifelse`](@ref)   function instead of `?:` in the loop if it is safe to do so.
  * Accesses must have a stride pattern and cannot be "gathers" (random-index   reads) or "scatters" (random-index writes).
  * The stride should be unit stride.

!!! note
    The `@simd` does not assert by default that the loop is completely free of loop-carried memory dependencies, which is an assumption that can easily be violated in generic code. If you are writing non-generic code, you can use `@simd ivdep for ... end` to also assert that:


  * There exists no loop-carried memory dependencies
  * No iteration ever waits on a previous iteration to make forward progress.
```
@something(x...)
```

Short-circuiting version of [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x) = (println("f($x)"); nothing);

julia> a = 1;

julia> a = @something a f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `a`")
1

julia> b = nothing;

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) error("Unable to find default for `b`")
f(2)
f(3)
ERROR: Unable to find default for `b`
[...]

julia> b = @something b f(2) f(3) Some(nothing)
f(2)
f(3)

julia> b === nothing
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This macro is available as of Julia 1.7.

```
@specialize
```

Reset the specialization hint for an argument back to the default. For details, see [`@nospecialize`](@ref).
```
@static
```

Partially evaluate an expression at parse time.

For example, `@static Sys.iswindows() ? foo : bar` will evaluate `Sys.iswindows()` and insert either `foo` or `bar` into the expression. This is useful in cases where a construct would be invalid on other platforms, such as a `ccall` to a non-existent function. `@static if Sys.isapple() foo end` and `@static foo <&&,||> bar` are also valid syntax.
```
@sync
```

Wait until all lexically-enclosed uses of `@async`, `@spawn`, `@spawnat` and `@distributed` are complete. All exceptions thrown by enclosed async operations are collected and thrown as a `CompositeException`.
```
@task
```

Wrap an expression in a [`Task`](@ref) without executing it, and return the [`Task`](@ref). This only creates a task, and does not run it.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a1() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = @task a1();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
@text_str -> Docs.Text
```

Create a `Text` object from a literal string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> text"Julia"
Julia
```
```
@threadcall((cfunc, clib), rettype, (argtypes...), argvals...)
```

The `@threadcall` macro is called in the same way as [`ccall`](@ref) but does the work in a different thread. This is useful when you want to call a blocking C function without causing the main `julia` thread to become blocked. Concurrency is limited by size of the libuv thread pool, which defaults to 4 threads but can be increased by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable and restarting the `julia` process.

Note that the called function should never call back into Julia.
```
@time expr
@time "description" expr
```

A macro to execute an expression, printing the time it took to execute, the number of allocations, and the total number of bytes its execution caused to be allocated, before returning the value of the expression. Any time spent garbage collecting (gc), compiling new code, or recompiling invalidated code is shown as a percentage.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@time` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@time @eval ...`.

See also [`@showtime`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@timed`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

!!! note
    For more serious benchmarking, consider the `@btime` macro from the BenchmarkTools.jl package which among other things evaluates the function multiple times in order to reduce noise.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The option to add a description was introduced in Julia 1.8.

    Recompilation time being shown separately from compilation time was introduced in Julia 1.8


```julia-repl
julia> x = rand(10,10);

julia> @time x * x;
  0.606588 seconds (2.19 M allocations: 116.555 MiB, 3.75% gc time, 99.94% compilation time)

julia> @time x * x;

2: 1.001263 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
3: 1.003676 seconds (5 allocations: 144 bytes)
```
```
@timed
```

A macro to execute an expression, and return the value of the expression, elapsed time, total bytes allocated, garbage collection time, and an object with various memory allocation counters.

In some cases the system will look inside the `@timed` expression and compile some of the called code before execution of the top-level expression begins. When that happens, some compilation time will not be counted. To include this time you can run `@timed @eval ...`.

See also [`@time`](@ref), [`@timev`](@ref), [`@elapsed`](@ref), and [`@allocated`](@ref).

```julia-repl
julia> stats = @timed rand(10^6);

julia> stats.time

```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The return type of this macro was changed from `Tuple` to `NamedTuple` in Julia 1.5.

```
@timev expr
@timev "description" expr
```

This is a verbose version of the `@time` macro. It first prints the same information as `@time`, then any non-zero memory allocation counters, and then returns the value of the expression.

Optionally provide a description string to print before the time report.

```
@uint128_str str
@uint128_str(str)
```

`@uint128_str` parses a string into a UInt128. Throws an `ArgumentError` if the string is not a valid integer.
```
@v_str
```

String macro used to parse a string to a [`VersionNumber`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v"1.2.3"
v"1.2.3"

julia> v"2.0.1-rc1"
v"2.0.1-rc1"
```
```
@view A[inds...]
```

Transform the indexing expression `A[inds...]` into the equivalent [`view`](@ref) call.

This can only be applied directly to a single indexing expression and is particularly helpful for expressions that include the special `begin` or `end` indexing syntaxes like `A[begin, 2:end-1]` (as those are not supported by the normal [`view`](@ref) function).

Note that `@view` cannot be used as the target of a regular assignment (e.g., `@view(A[1, 2:end]) = ...`), nor would the un-decorated [indexed assignment](@ref man-indexed-assignment) (`A[1, 2:end] = ...`) or broadcasted indexed assignment (`A[1, 2:end] .= ...`) make a copy.  It can be useful, however, for *updating* broadcasted assignments like `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .+= 1` because this is a simple syntax for `@view(A[1, 2:end]) .= @view(A[1, 2:end]) + 1`, and the indexing expression on the right-hand side would otherwise make a copy without the `@view`.

See also [`@views`](@ref) to switch an entire block of code to use views for non-scalar indexing.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = @view A[:, 1]
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4
```
```
@views expression
```

Convert every array-slicing operation in the given expression (which may be a `begin`/`end` block, loop, function, etc.) to return a view. Scalar indices, non-array types, and explicit [`getindex`](@ref) calls (as opposed to `array[...]`) are unaffected.

!!! note
    The `@views` macro only affects `array[...]` expressions that appear explicitly in the given `expression`, not array slicing that occurs in functions called by that code.


!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Using `begin` in an indexing expression to refer to the first index requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(3, 3);

julia> @views for row in 1:3
           b = A[row, :]
           b[:] .= row
       end

julia> A
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 3.0  3.0  3.0
```
```
@debug message  [key=value | value ...]
@info  message  [key=value | value ...]
@warn  message  [key=value | value ...]
@error message  [key=value | value ...]

@logmsg level message [key=value | value ...]
```

Create a log record with an informational `message`.  For convenience, four logging macros `@debug`, `@info`, `@warn` and `@error` are defined which log at the standard severity levels `Debug`, `Info`, `Warn` and `Error`.  `@logmsg` allows `level` to be set programmatically to any `LogLevel` or custom log level types.

`message` should be an expression which evaluates to a string which is a human readable description of the log event.  By convention, this string will be formatted as markdown when presented.

The optional list of `key=value` pairs supports arbitrary user defined metadata which will be passed through to the logging backend as part of the log record.  If only a `value` expression is supplied, a key representing the expression will be generated using [`Symbol`](@ref). For example, `x` becomes `x=x`, and `foo(10)` becomes `Symbol("foo(10)")=foo(10)`.  For splatting a list of key value pairs, use the normal splatting syntax, `@info "blah" kws...`.

There are some keys which allow automatically generated log data to be overridden:

  * `_module=mod` can be used to specify a different originating module from the source location of the message.
  * `_group=symbol` can be used to override the message group (this is normally derived from the base name of the source file).
  * `_id=symbol` can be used to override the automatically generated unique message identifier.  This is useful if you need to very closely associate messages generated on different source lines.
  * `_file=string` and `_line=integer` can be used to override the apparent source location of a log message.

There's also some key value pairs which have conventional meaning:

  * `maxlog=integer` should be used as a hint to the backend that the message should be displayed no more than `maxlog` times.
  * `exception=ex` should be used to transport an exception with a log message, often used with `@error`. An associated backtrace `bt` may be attached using the tuple `exception=(ex,bt)`.

# Examples

```julia
@debug "Verbose debugging information.  Invisible by default"
@info  "An informational message"
@warn  "Something was odd.  You should pay attention"
@error "A non fatal error occurred"

x = 10
@info "Some variables attached to the message" x a=42.0

@debug begin
    sA = sum(A)
    "sum(A) = $sA is an expensive operation, evaluated only when `shouldlog` returns true"
end

for i=1:10000
    @info "With the default backend, you will only see (i = $i) ten times"  maxlog=10
    @debug "Algorithm1" i progress=i/10000
end
```
```
PipeBuffer(data::Vector{UInt8}=UInt8[]; maxsize::Integer = typemax(Int))
```

An [`IOBuffer`](@ref) that allows reading and performs writes by appending. Seeking and truncating are not supported. See [`IOBuffer`](@ref) for the available constructors. If `data` is given, creates a `PipeBuffer` to operate on a data vector, optionally specifying a size beyond which the underlying `Array` may not be grown.
```
\(x, y)
```

Left division operator: multiplication of `y` by the inverse of `x` on the left. Gives floating-point results for integer arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 \ 6
2.0

julia> inv(3) * 6
2.0

julia> A = [4 3; 2 1]; x = [5, 6];

julia> A \ x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0

julia> inv(A) * x
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  6.5
 -7.0
```

```
\(A, B)
```

Matrix division using a polyalgorithm. For input matrices `A` and `B`, the result `X` is such that `A*X == B` when `A` is square. The solver that is used depends upon the structure of `A`.  If `A` is upper or lower triangular (or diagonal), no factorization of `A` is required and the system is solved with either forward or backward substitution. For non-triangular square matrices, an LU factorization is used.

For rectangular `A` the result is the minimum-norm least squares solution computed by a pivoted QR factorization of `A` and a rank estimate of `A` based on the R factor.

When `A` is sparse, a similar polyalgorithm is used. For indefinite matrices, the `LDLt` factorization does not use pivoting during the numerical factorization and therefore the procedure can fail even for invertible matrices.

See also: [`factorize`](@ref), [`pinv`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 0; 1 -2]; B = [32; -4];

julia> X = A \ B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 32.0
 18.0

julia> A * X == B
true
```

```
(\)(F::QRSparse, B::StridedVecOrMat)
```

Solve the least squares problem $\min\|Ax - b\|^2$ or the linear system of equations $Ax=b$ when `F` is the sparse QR factorization of $A$. A basic solution is returned when the problem is underdetermined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = sparse([1,2,4], [1,1,1], [1.0,1.0,1.0], 4, 2)
4×2 SparseMatrixCSC{Float64, Int64} with 3 stored entries:
 1.0   ⋅
 1.0   ⋅
  ⋅    ⋅
 1.0   ⋅

julia> qr(A)\fill(1.0, 4)
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0
```
```
^(x, y)
```

Exponentiation operator. If `x` is a matrix, computes matrix exponentiation.

If `y` is an `Int` literal (e.g. `2` in `x^2` or `-3` in `x^-3`), the Julia code `x^y` is transformed by the compiler to `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y))`, to enable compile-time specialization on the value of the exponent. (As a default fallback we have `Base.literal_pow(^, x, Val(y)) = ^(x,y)`, where usually `^ == Base.^` unless `^` has been defined in the calling namespace.) If `y` is a negative integer literal, then `Base.literal_pow` transforms the operation to `inv(x)^-y` by default, where `-y` is positive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3^5
243

julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> A^3
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 37   54
 81  118
```

```
^(s::Union{AbstractString,AbstractChar}, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a string or character `n` times. This can also be written as `repeat(s, n)`.

See also [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

"Test Test Test "
```

```
^(s::Regex, n::Integer)
```

Repeat a regex `n` times.

```
```
__precompile__(isprecompilable::Bool)
```

Specify whether the file calling this function is precompilable, defaulting to `true`. If a module or file is *not* safely precompilable, it should call `__precompile__(false)` in order to throw an error if Julia attempts to precompile it.
```
abs(x)
```

The absolute value of `x`.

When `abs` is applied to signed integers, overflow may occur, resulting in the return of a negative value. This overflow occurs only when `abs` is applied to the minimum representable value of a signed integer. That is, when `x == typemin(typeof(x))`, `abs(x) == x < 0`, not `-x` as might be expected.

See also: [`abs2`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> abs(-3)

```
abspath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to an absolute path by joining them together and adding the current directory if necessary. Equivalent to `abspath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
accumulate(op, A; dims::Integer, [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` along the dimension `dims` of `A` (providing `dims` is optional for vectors). An initial value `init` may optionally be provided by a keyword argument. See also [`accumulate!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

For common operations there are specialized variants of `accumulate`, see [`cumsum`](@ref), [`cumprod`](@ref). For a lazy version, see [`Iterators.accumulate`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
accumulate!(op, B, A; [dims], [init])
```

Cumulative operation `op` on `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. Providing `dims` is optional for vectors.  If the keyword argument `init` is given, its value is used to instantiate the accumulation.

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_5].

[^AH16_5]: Mary Aprahamian and Nicholas J. Higham, "Matrix Inverse Trigonometric and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions: Theory and Algorithms", MIMS EPrint: 2016.4. [https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577)
```
asyncmap(f, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Uses multiple concurrent tasks to map `f` over a collection (or multiple equal length collections). For multiple collection arguments, `f` is applied elementwise.

`ntasks` specifies the number of tasks to run concurrently. Depending on the length of the collections, if `ntasks` is unspecified, up to 100 tasks will be used for concurrent mapping.

`ntasks` can also be specified as a zero-arg function. In this case, the number of tasks to run in parallel is checked before processing every element and a new task started if the value of `ntasks_func` is greater than the current number of tasks.

If `batch_size` is specified, the collection is processed in batch mode. `f` must then be a function that must accept a `Vector` of argument tuples and must return a vector of results. The input vector will have a length of `batch_size` or less.

The following examples highlight execution in different tasks by returning the `objectid` of the tasks in which the mapping function is executed.

First, with `ntasks` undefined, each element is processed in a different task.

```
julia> tskoid() = objectid(current_task());

julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x6e15e66c75c75853
 0x440f8819a1baa682
 0x9fb3eeadd0c83985
 0xebd3e35fe90d4050
 0x29efc93edce2b961

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5)))
5
```

With `ntasks=2` all elements are processed in 2 tasks.

```
julia> asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)
5-element Array{UInt64,1}:
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94
 0xa23d2f80cd7cf157
 0x027ab1680df7ae94

julia> length(unique(asyncmap(x->tskoid(), 1:5; ntasks=2)))
2
```

With `batch_size` defined, the mapping function needs to be changed to accept an array of argument tuples and return an array of results. `map` is used in the modified mapping function to achieve this.

```
julia> batch_func(input) = map(x->string("args_tuple: ", x, ", element_val: ", x[1], ", task: ", tskoid()), input)
batch_func (generic function with 1 method)

julia> asyncmap(batch_func, 1:5; ntasks=2, batch_size=2)
5-element Array{String,1}:
 "args_tuple: (1,), element_val: 1, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (2,), element_val: 2, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (3,), element_val: 3, task: 9118321258196414413"
 "args_tuple: (4,), element_val: 4, task: 4904288162898683522"
 "args_tuple: (5,), element_val: 5, task: 9118321258196414413"
```

!!! note
    Currently, all tasks in Julia are executed in a single OS thread co-operatively. Consequently, `asyncmap` is beneficial only when the mapping function involves any I/O - disk, network, remote worker invocation, etc.

```
asyncmap!(f, results, c...; ntasks=0, batch_size=nothing)
```

Like [`asyncmap`](@ref), but stores output in `results` rather than returning a collection.
```
atan(y)
atan(y, x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively.

For one argument, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (1, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$.

For two arguments, this is the angle in radians between the positive *x*-axis and the point (*x*, *y*), returning a value in the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. This corresponds to a standard [`atan2`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atan2) function. Note that by convention `atan(0.0,x)` is defined as $\pi$ and `atan(-0.0,x)` is defined as $-\pi$ when `x < 0`.

```
atan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the inverse tangent. Otherwise, the inverse tangent is determined by using [`log`](@ref).  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_3].

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> atan(tan([0.5 0.1; -0.2 0.3]))
2×2 Matrix{ComplexF64}:
  0.5+1.38778e-17im  0.1-2.77556e-17im
 -0.2+6.93889e-17im  0.3-4.16334e-17im
```
```
atand(y)
atand(y,x)
```

Compute the inverse tangent of `y` or `y/x`, respectively, where the output is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The one-argument method supports square matrix arguments as of Julia 1.7.

```
atanh(x)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
atanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the inverse hyperbolic matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.  For the theory and logarithmic formulas used to compute this function, see [^AH16_6].

[^AH16_6]: Mary Aprahamian and Nicholas J. Higham, "Matrix Inverse Trigonometric and Inverse Hyperbolic Functions: Theory and Algorithms", MIMS EPrint: 2016.4. [https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577](https://doi.org/10.1137/16M1057577)
```
atexit(f)
```

Register a zero-argument function `f()` to be called at process exit. `atexit()` hooks are called in last in first out (LIFO) order and run before object finalizers.

Exit hooks are allowed to call `exit(n)`, in which case Julia will exit with exit code `n` (instead of the original exit code). If more than one exit hook calls `exit(n)`, then Julia will exit with the exit code corresponding to the last called exit hook that calls `exit(n)`. (Because exit hooks are called in LIFO order, "last called" is equivalent to "first registered".)
```
atreplinit(f)
```

Register a one-argument function to be called before the REPL interface is initialized in interactive sessions; this is useful to customize the interface. The argument of `f` is the REPL object. This function should be called from within the `.julia/config/startup.jl` initialization file.
```
axes(A, d)
```

Return the valid range of indices for array `A` along dimension `d`.

See also [`size`](@ref), and the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A, 2)
Base.OneTo(6)
```

# Usage note

Each of the indices has to be an `AbstractUnitRange{<:Integer}`, but at the same time can be a type that uses custom indices. So, for example, if you need a subset, use generalized indexing constructs like `begin`/`end` or [`firstindex`](@ref)/[`lastindex`](@ref):

```julia
ix = axes(v, 1)
ix[2:end]          # will work for eg Vector, but may fail in general
ix[(begin+1):end]  # works for generalized indexes
```

```
axes(A)
```

Return the tuple of valid indices for array `A`.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (5,6,7));

julia> axes(A)
(Base.OneTo(5), Base.OneTo(6), Base.OneTo(7))
```
```
backtrace()
```

Get a backtrace object for the current program point.
```
basename(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the file name part of a path.

!!! note
    This function differs slightly from the Unix `basename` program, where trailing slashes are ignored, i.e. `$ basename /foo/bar/` returns `bar`, whereas `basename` in Julia returns an empty string `""`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> basename("/home/myuser/example.jl")
"example.jl"

julia> basename("/home/myuser/")
""
```

See also [`dirname`](@ref).
```
big(T::Type)
```

Compute the type that represents the numeric type `T` with arbitrary precision. Equivalent to `typeof(big(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> big(Rational)
Rational{BigInt}

julia> big(Float64)
BigFloat

julia> big(Complex{Int})
Complex{BigInt}
```

```
big(x)
```

Convert a number to a maximum precision representation (typically [`BigInt`](@ref) or `BigFloat`). See [`BigFloat`](@ref BigFloat(::Any, rounding::RoundingMode)) for information about some pitfalls with floating-point numbers.
```
bind(chnl::Channel, task::Task)
```

Associate the lifetime of `chnl` with a task. `Channel` `chnl` is automatically closed when the task terminates. Any uncaught exception in the task is propagated to all waiters on `chnl`.

The `chnl` object can be explicitly closed independent of task termination. Terminating tasks have no effect on already closed `Channel` objects.

When a channel is bound to multiple tasks, the first task to terminate will close the channel. When multiple channels are bound to the same task, termination of the task will close all of the bound channels.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async foreach(i->put!(c, i), 1:4);

julia> bind(c,task);

julia> for i in c
           @show i
       end;
i = 1
i = 2
i = 3
i = 4

julia> isopen(c)
false
```

```jldoctest
julia> c = Channel(0);

julia> task = @async (put!(c, 1); error("foo"));

julia> bind(c, task);

julia> take!(c)
1

julia> put!(c, 1);
ERROR: TaskFailedException
Stacktrace:
[...]
    nested task error: foo
[...]
```

```
bind(socket::Union{TCPServer, UDPSocket, TCPSocket}, host::IPAddr, port::Integer; ipv6only=false, reuseaddr=false, kws...)
```

Bind `socket` to the given `host:port`. Note that `0.0.0.0` will listen on all devices.

  * The `ipv6only` parameter disables dual stack mode. If `ipv6only=true`, only an IPv6 stack is created.
  * If `reuseaddr=true`, multiple threads or processes can bind to the same address without error if they all set `reuseaddr=true`, but only the last to bind will receive any traffic.
```
binomial(n::Integer, k::Integer)
```

The *binomial coefficient* $\binom{n}{k}$, being the coefficient of the $k$th term in the polynomial expansion of $(1+x)^n$.

If $n$ is non-negative, then it is the number of ways to choose `k` out of `n` items:

$$
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!}
$$

where $n!$ is the [`factorial`](@ref) function.

If $n$ is negative, then it is defined in terms of the identity

$$
\binom{n}{k} = (-1)^k \binom{k-n-1}{k}
$$

See also [`factorial`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> binomial(5, 3)
10

julia> factorial(5) ÷ (factorial(5-3) * factorial(3))
10

julia> binomial(-5, 3)
-35
```

```
bitreverse(x)
```

Reverse the order of bits in integer `x`. `x` must have a fixed bit width, e.g. be an `Int16` or `Int32`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitreverse(0x8080808080808080)
0x0101010101010101

julia> reverse(bitstring(0xa06e)) == bitstring(bitreverse(0xa06e))
true
```
```
bitrotate(x::Base.BitInteger, k::Integer)
```

`bitrotate(x, k)` implements bitwise rotation. It returns the value of `x` with its bits rotated left `k` times. A negative value of `k` will rotate to the right instead.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires Julia 1.5 or later.


See also: [`<<`](@ref), [`circshift`](@ref), [`BitArray`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> bitrotate(UInt8(114), 2)

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 2))
"11001001"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, -2))
"10011100"

julia> bitstring(bitrotate(0b01110010, 8))
"01110010"
```
```
bitstring(n)
```

A string giving the literal bit representation of a primitive type.

See also [`count_ones`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref), [`digits`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> bitstring(Int32(4))
"00000000000000000000000000000100"

julia> bitstring(2.2)
"0100000000000001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011010"
```
```
broadcast(f, As...)
```

Broadcast the function `f` over the arrays, tuples, collections, [`Ref`](@ref)s and/or scalars `As`.

Broadcasting applies the function `f` over the elements of the container arguments and the scalars themselves in `As`. Singleton and missing dimensions are expanded to match the extents of the other arguments by virtually repeating the value. By default, only a limited number of types are considered scalars, including `Number`s, `String`s, `Symbol`s, `Type`s, `Function`s and some common singletons like [`missing`](@ref) and [`nothing`](@ref). All other arguments are iterated over or indexed into elementwise.

The resulting container type is established by the following rules:

  * If all the arguments are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns an unwrapped scalar.
  * If at least one argument is a tuple and all others are scalars or zero-dimensional arrays, it returns a tuple.
  * All other combinations of arguments default to returning an `Array`, but custom container types can define their own implementation and promotion-like rules to customize the result when they appear as arguments.

A special syntax exists for broadcasting: `f.(args...)` is equivalent to `broadcast(f, args...)`, and nested `f.(g.(args...))` calls are fused into a single broadcast loop.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4; 5 6; 7 8; 9 10]
5×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2
 3   4
 5   6
 7   8

julia> parse.(Int, ["1", "2"])
2-element Vector{Int64}:

julia> abs.((1, -2))
(1, 2)

julia> broadcast(+, 1.0, (0, -2.0))
(1.0, -1.0)

julia> (+).([[0,2], [1,3]], Ref{Vector{Int}}([1,-1]))
2-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]

julia> string.(("one","two","three","four"), ": ", 1:4)
4-element Vector{String}:
 "one: 1"
 "two: 2"
 "three: 3"
 "four: 4"

```
```
broadcast!(f, dest, As...)
```

Like [`broadcast`](@ref), but store the result of `broadcast(f, As...)` in the `dest` array. Note that `dest` is only used to store the result, and does not supply arguments to `f` unless it is also listed in the `As`, as in `broadcast!(f, A, A, B)` to perform `A[:] = broadcast(f, A, B)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1.0; 0.0]; B = [0.0; 0.0];

julia> broadcast!(+, B, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> B
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 0.0

julia> broadcast!(+, A, A, (0, -2.0));

julia> A
2-element Vector{Float64}:
  1.0
 -2.0
```
```
bswap(n)
```

Reverse the byte order of `n`.

(See also [`ntoh`](@ref) and [`hton`](@ref) to convert between the current native byte order and big-endian order.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = bswap(0x10203040)
0x40302010

julia> bswap(a)
0x10203040

julia> string(1, base = 2)
"1"

julia> string(bswap(1), base = 2)
"100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
```
```
bytes2hex(itr) -> String
bytes2hex(io::IO, itr)
```

Convert an iterator `itr` of bytes to its hexadecimal string representation, either returning a `String` via `bytes2hex(itr)` or writing the string to an `io` stream via `bytes2hex(io, itr)`.  The hexadecimal characters are all lowercase.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `bytes2hex` with arbitrary iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `bytes2hex`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> b = hex2bytes(a)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> bytes2hex(b)
"3039"
```
```
bytesavailable(io)
```

Return the number of bytes available for reading before a read from this stream or buffer will block.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> bytesavailable(io)
34
```
```
cat(A...; dims)
```

Concatenate the input arrays along the specified dimensions in the iterable `dims`. For dimensions not in `dims`, all input arrays should have the same size, which will also be the size of the output array along that dimension. For dimensions in `dims`, the size of the output array is the sum of the sizes of the input arrays along that dimension. If `dims` is a single number, the different arrays are tightly stacked along that dimension. If `dims` is an iterable containing several dimensions, this allows one to construct block diagonal matrices and their higher-dimensional analogues by simultaneously increasing several dimensions for every new input array and putting zero blocks elsewhere. For example, `cat(matrices...; dims=(1,2))` builds a block diagonal matrix, i.e. a block matrix with `matrices[1]`, `matrices[2]`, ... as diagonal blocks and matching zero blocks away from the diagonal.

See also [`hcat`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`hvcat`](@ref), [`repeat`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cat([1 2; 3 4], [pi, pi], fill(10, 2,3,1); dims=2)
2×6×1 Array{Float64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1.0  2.0  3.14159  10.0  10.0  10.0
 3.0  4.0  3.14159  10.0  10.0  10.0

julia> cat(true, trues(2,2), trues(4)', dims=(1,2))
4×7 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  0  0  0  0  0  0
 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
 0  0  0  1  1  1  1
```
```
catch_backtrace()
```

Get the backtrace of the current exception, for use within `catch` blocks.
```
cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```
```
cd(dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Set the current working directory.

See also: [`pwd`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref), [`mkpath`](@ref), [`mktempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"

julia> cd()

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"
```

```
cd(f::Function, dir::AbstractString=homedir())
```

Temporarily change the current working directory to `dir`, apply function `f` and finally return to the original directory.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd(readdir, "/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")
34-element Array{String,1}:
 ".circleci"
 ".freebsdci.sh"

```
```
ceil([T,] x)
ceil(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
ceil(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`ceil(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is greater than or equal to `x`.

`ceil(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
ceil(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` greater than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-09-01

julia> ceil(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:45:00

julia> ceil(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

```
ceil(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` up to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `ceil(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `ceil(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> ceil(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
3 weeks

julia> ceil(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> ceil(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
cglobal((symbol, library) [, type=Cvoid])
```

Obtain a pointer to a global variable in a C-exported shared library, specified exactly as in [`ccall`](@ref). Returns a `Ptr{Type}`, defaulting to `Ptr{Cvoid}` if no `Type` argument is supplied. The values can be read or written by [`unsafe_load`](@ref) or [`unsafe_store!`](@ref), respectively.
```
checkbounds(Bool, A, I...)
```

Return `true` if the specified indices `I` are in bounds for the given array `A`. Subtypes of `AbstractArray` should specialize this method if they need to provide custom bounds checking behaviors; however, in many cases one can rely on `A`'s indices and [`checkindex`](@ref).

See also [`checkindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = rand(3, 3);

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 2)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 3, 4)
false

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3)
true

julia> checkbounds(Bool, A, 1:3, 2:4)
false
```

```
checkbounds(A, I...)
```

Throw an error if the specified indices `I` are not in bounds for the given array `A`.
```
checkindex(Bool, inds::AbstractUnitRange, index)
```

Return `true` if the given `index` is within the bounds of `inds`. Custom types that would like to behave as indices for all arrays can extend this method in order to provide a specialized bounds checking implementation.

See also [`checkbounds`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 8)
true

julia> checkindex(Bool, 1:20, 21)
false
```
```
chmod(path::AbstractString, mode::Integer; recursive::Bool=false)
```

Change the permissions mode of `path` to `mode`. Only integer `mode`s (e.g. `0o777`) are currently supported. If `recursive=true` and the path is a directory all permissions in that directory will be recursively changed. Return `path`.

!!! note
    Prior to Julia 1.6, this did not correctly manipulate filesystem ACLs  on Windows, therefore it would only set read-only bits on files.  It  now is able to manipulate ACLs.

```
chomp(s::AbstractString) -> SubString
```

Remove a single trailing newline from a string.

See also [`chop`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chomp("Hello\n")
"Hello"
```
```
chop(s::AbstractString; head::Integer = 0, tail::Integer = 1)
```

Remove the first `head` and the last `tail` characters from `s`. The call `chop(s)` removes the last character from `s`. If it is requested to remove more characters than `length(s)` then an empty string is returned.

See also [`chomp`](@ref), [`startswith`](@ref), [`first`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "March"
"March"

julia> chop(a)
"Marc"

julia> chop(a, head = 1, tail = 2)
"ar"

julia> chop(a, head = 5, tail = 5)
""
```
```
chopprefix(s::AbstractString, prefix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the prefix `prefix` from `s`. If `s` does not start with `prefix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopsuffix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "Ham")
"burger"

julia> chopprefix("Hamburger", "hotdog")
"Hamburger"
```
```
chopsuffix(s::AbstractString, suffix::Union{AbstractString,Regex}) -> SubString
```

Remove the suffix `suffix` from `s`. If `s` does not end with `suffix`, a string equal to `s` is returned.

See also [`chopprefix`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest

"Hamburger"
```
```
chown(path::AbstractString, owner::Integer, group::Integer=-1)
```

Change the owner and/or group of `path` to `owner` and/or `group`. If the value entered for `owner` or `group` is `-1` the corresponding ID will not change. Only integer `owner`s and `group`s are currently supported. Return `path`.
```
circcopy!(dest, src)
```

Copy `src` to `dest`, indexing each dimension modulo its length. `src` and `dest` must have the same size, but can be offset in their indices; any offset results in a (circular) wraparound. If the arrays have overlapping indices, then on the domain of the overlap `dest` agrees with `src`.

See also: [`circshift`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> src = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14

 7  11  15  3

julia> dest[1:3,2:4] == src[1:3,2:4]
true
```
```
circshift(A, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in an array. The second argument is a tuple or vector giving the amount to shift in each dimension, or an integer to shift only in the first dimension.

circshift!(dest, src, shifts)
```

Circularly shift, i.e. rotate, the data in `src`, storing the result in `dest`. `shifts` specifies the amount to shift in each dimension.

The `dest` array must be distinct from the `src` array (they cannot alias each other).

```
```
close(stream)
```

Close an I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first.

```
close(c::Channel[, excp::Exception])
```

Close a channel. An exception (optionally given by `excp`), is thrown by:

  * [`put!`](@ref) on a closed channel.
  * [`take!`](@ref) and [`fetch`](@ref) on an empty, closed channel.
```
closewrite(stream)
```

Shutdown the write half of a full-duplex I/O stream. Performs a [`flush`](@ref) first. Notify the other end that no more data will be written to the underlying file. This is not supported by all IO types.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = Base.BufferStream(); # this never blocks, so we can read and write on the same Task

julia> write(io, "request");

julia> # calling `read(io)` here would block forever

julia> closewrite(io);

julia> read(io, String)
"request"
```
```
cmp(x,y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. Uses the total order implemented by `isless`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp(1, 2)
-1

[...]
```

```
cmp(<, x, y)
```

Return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `y`, respectively. The first argument specifies a less-than comparison function to use.

```
cmp(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Compare two strings. Return `0` if both strings have the same length and the character at each index is the same in both strings. Return `-1` if `a` is a prefix of `b`, or if `a` comes before `b` in alphabetical order. Return `1` if `b` is a prefix of `a`, or if `b` comes before `a` in alphabetical order (technically, lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cmp("abc", "abc")
0

julia> cmp("ab", "abc")
-1

julia> cmp("abc", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("ab", "ac")
-1

julia> cmp("ac", "ab")
1

julia> cmp("α", "a")
1

julia> cmp("b", "β")
-1
```
```
coalesce(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`missing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise return `missing`.

See also [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref), [`@coalesce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

julia> coalesce(missing, missing)
missing
```
```
code_lowered(f, types; generated=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Return an array of the lowered forms (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

If `generated` is `false`, the returned `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to fallback implementations. An error is thrown if no fallback implementation exists. If `generated` is `true`, these `CodeInfo` instances will correspond to the method bodies yielded by expanding the generators.

The keyword `debuginfo` controls the amount of code metadata present in the output.

Note that an error will be thrown if `types` are not leaf types when `generated` is `true` and any of the corresponding methods are an `@generated` method.
```
code_typed(f, types; kw...)
```

Returns an array of type-inferred lowered form (IR) for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature.

# Keyword Arguments

  * `optimize=true`: controls whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied.
  * `debuginfo=:default`: controls the amount of code metadata present in the output,

possible options are `:source` or `:none`.

# Internal Keyword Arguments

This section should be considered internal, and is only for who understands Julia compiler internals.

  * `world=Base.get_world_counter()`: optional, controls the world age to use when looking up methods,

use current world age if not specified.

  * `interp=Core.Compiler.NativeInterpreter(world)`: optional, controls the interpreter to use,

use the native interpreter Julia uses if not specified.

# Example

One can put the argument types in a tuple to get the corresponding `code_typed`.

```julia
julia> code_typed(+, (Float64, Float64))
1-element Vector{Any}:
 CodeInfo(
1 ─ %1 = Base.add_float(x, y)::Float64
└──      return %1
) => Float64
```
```
codepoint(c::AbstractChar) -> Integer
```

Return the Unicode codepoint (an unsigned integer) corresponding to the character `c` (or throw an exception if `c` does not represent a valid character). For `Char`, this is a `UInt32` value, but `AbstractChar` types that represent only a subset of Unicode may return a different-sized integer (e.g. `UInt8`).
```
codeunit(s::AbstractString) -> Type{<:Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}}
```

Return the code unit type of the given string object. For ASCII, Latin-1, or UTF-8 encoded strings, this would be `UInt8`; for UCS-2 and UTF-16 it would be `UInt16`; for UTF-32 it would be `UInt32`. The code unit type need not be limited to these three types, but it's hard to think of widely used string encodings that don't use one of these units. `codeunit(s)` is the same as `typeof(codeunit(s,1))` when `s` is a non-empty string.

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref).

```
codeunit(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{UInt8, UInt16, UInt32}
```

Return the code unit value in the string `s` at index `i`. Note that

```
codeunit(s, i) :: codeunit(s)
```

I.e. the value returned by `codeunit(s, i)` is of the type returned by `codeunit(s)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = codeunit("Hello", 2)
0x65

julia> typeof(a)
UInt8
```

See also [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
codeunits(s::AbstractString)
```

Obtain a vector-like object containing the code units of a string. Returns a `CodeUnits` wrapper by default, but `codeunits` may optionally be defined for new string types if necessary.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> codeunits("Juλia")
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x4a
 0x75
 0xce
 0xbb
 0x69
 0x61
```
```
collect(element_type, collection)
```

Return an `Array` with the given element type of all items in a collection or iterable. The result has the same shape and number of dimensions as `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(Float64, 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.0
 3.0
 5.0
```

```
collect(collection)
```

Return an `Array` of all items in a collection or iterator. For dictionaries, returns `Pair{KeyType, ValType}`. If the argument is array-like or is an iterator with the [`HasShape`](@ref IteratorSize) trait, the result will have the same shape and number of dimensions as the argument.

Used by comprehensions to turn a generator into an `Array`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> collect(1:2:13)
7-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
 11

4-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  9
 25
 49
```
```
complex(r, [i])
```

Convert real numbers or arrays to complex. `i` defaults to zero.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(7)
7 + 0im

julia> complex([1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 2 + 0im
 3 + 0im
```

```
complex(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type which can represent a value of type `T` as a complex number. Equivalent to `typeof(complex(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> complex(Complex{Int})
Complex{Int64}

julia> complex(Int)
Complex{Int64}
```
```
conj(z)
```

Compute the complex conjugate of a complex number `z`.

See also: [`angle`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj(1 + 3im)
1 - 3im
```

```
conj(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the complex conjugate of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `conj.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> conj([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Complex{Int64}}:
 1 + 0im
 0 - 2im
 3 - 4im

julia> conj(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Complex{Int64}, 0}:
2 + 1im
```
```
conj!(A)
```

2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1-1im  2+1im
 2-2im  3-1im
```
```
contains(haystack::AbstractString, needle)
```

Return `true` if `haystack` contains `needle`. This is the same as `occursin(needle, haystack)`, but is provided for consistency with `startswith(haystack, needle)` and `endswith(haystack, needle)`.

See also [`occursin`](@ref), [`in`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", "Julia")
true

julia> contains("JuliaLang is pretty cool!", 'a')
true

julia> contains("aba", r"a.a")
true

julia> contains("abba", r"a.a")
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `contains` function requires at least Julia 1.5.


```
contains(needle)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument contains `needle`, i.e. a function equivalent to `haystack -> contains(haystack, needle)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(contains)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
No documentation found.

Binding `contractuser` does not exist.
```
convert(T, x)
```

Convert `x` to a value of type `T`.

If `T` is an [`Integer`](@ref) type, an [`InexactError`](@ref) will be raised if `x` is not representable by `T`, for example if `x` is not integer-valued, or is outside the range supported by `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> convert(Int, 3.0)
3

julia> convert(Int, 3.5)
ERROR: InexactError: Int64(3.5)
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

If `T` is a [`AbstractFloat`](@ref) type, then it will return the closest value to `x` representable by `T`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = 1/3
0.3333333333333333

julia> convert(Float32, x)
0.33333334f0

julia> convert(BigFloat, x)
0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125
```

If `T` is a collection type and `x` a collection, the result of `convert(T, x)` may alias all or part of `x`.

```jldoctest
julia> x = Int[1, 2, 3];

julia> y = convert(Vector{Int}, x);

julia> y === x
true
```

See also: [`round`](@ref), [`trunc`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`reinterpret`](@ref).
```
copy(x)
```

Create a shallow copy of `x`: the outer structure is copied, but not all internal values. For example, copying an array produces a new array with identically-same elements as the original.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copyto!`](@ref).

```
copy(A::Transpose)
copy(A::Adjoint)
```

Eagerly evaluate the lazy matrix transpose/adjoint. Note that the transposition is applied recursively to elements.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2im; -3im 4]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0+2im
 0-3im  4+0im

2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 1+0im  0-3im
 0+2im  4+0im
```
```
copy!(dst, src) -> dst
```

In-place [`copy`](@ref) of `src` into `dst`, discarding any pre-existing elements in `dst`. If `dst` and `src` are of the same type, `dst == src` should hold after the call. If `dst` and `src` are multidimensional arrays, they must have equal [`axes`](@ref).

See also [`copyto!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 this method is available from the `Future` standard library as `Future.copy!`.

```
copysign(x, y) -> z
```

Return `z` which has the magnitude of `x` and the same sign as `y`.

# Examples

julia> copysign(-1, 2)
1
```
```
copyto!(dest, do, src, so, N)
```

```
copyto!(dest::AbstractArray, src) -> dest
```

Copy all elements from collection `src` to array `dest`, whose length must be greater than or equal to the length `n` of `src`. The first `n` elements of `dest` are overwritten, the other elements are left untouched.

See also [`copy!`](@ref Base.copy!), [`copy`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(5, 5);

julia> B = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> Ainds = CartesianIndices((2:3, 2:3));

julia> Binds = CartesianIndices(B);

```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`cosd`], [`cospi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
cos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the cosine. Otherwise, the cosine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

```
```
cosc(x)
```

Compute $\cos(\pi x) / x - \sin(\pi x) / (\pi x^2)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $0$ if $x = 0$. This is the derivative of `sinc(x)`.
```
cosd(x)
```

Compute cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"

```

Compute $\cos(\pi x)$ more accurately than `cos(pi*x)`, especially for large `x`.
```
cot(x)
```

Compute the cotangent of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cotangent of square matrix `A`.
```
count([f=identity,] itr; init=0) -> Integer
```

Count the number of elements in `itr` for which the function `f` returns `true`. If `f` is omitted, count the number of `true` elements in `itr` (which should be a collection of boolean values). `init` optionally specifies the value to start counting from and therefore also determines the output type.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


See also: [`any`](@ref), [`sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count(i->(4<=i<=6), [2,3,4,5,6])
3

julia> count([true, false, true, true])
3

julia> count(>(3), 1:7, init=0x03)
0x07
```

```
count(
    pattern::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return the number of matches for `pattern` in `string`. This is equivalent to calling `length(findall(pattern, string))` but more efficient.

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.3.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a character as the pattern requires at least Julia 1.7.


```
count([f=identity,] A::AbstractArray; dims=:)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the given dimensions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `dims` keyword was added in Julia 1.5.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `init` keyword was added in Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1

julia> count(<=(2), A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 0
```
```
count!([f=identity,] r, A)
```

Count the number of elements in `A` for which `f` returns `true` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, writing the result into `r` in-place.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    inplace `count!` was added in Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> count!(<=(2), [1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:

julia> count!(<=(2), [1; 1], A)
2-element Vector{Int64}:

 0
```
```
count_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_ones(7)
3

julia> count_ones(Int32(-1))
32
```
```
count_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros in the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> count_zeros(Int32(2 ^ 16 - 1))
16

julia> count_zeros(-1)
0
```
```
countlines(io::IO; eol::AbstractChar = '\n')
```

Read `io` until the end of the stream/file and count the number of lines. To specify a file pass the filename as the first argument. EOL markers other than `'\n'` are supported by passing them as the second argument.  The last non-empty line of `io` is counted even if it does not end with the EOL, matching the length returned by [`eachline`](@ref) and [`readlines`](@ref).

To count lines of a `String`, `countlines(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io)
1

julia> eof(io) # counting lines moves the file pointer
true

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> countlines(io, eol = '.')
1
```
```
cp(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, follow_symlinks::Bool=false)
```

Copy the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`.

If `follow_symlinks=false`, and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be created as a symbolic link. If `follow_symlinks=true` and `src` is a symbolic link, `dst` will be a copy of the file or directory `src` refers to. Return `dst`.

!!! note
    The `cp` function is different from the `cp` command. The `cp` function always operates on the assumption that `dst` is a file, while the command does different things depending on whether `dst` is a directory or a file. Using `force=true` when `dst` is a directory will result in loss of all the contents present in the `dst` directory, and `dst` will become a file that has the contents of `src` instead.

```
csc(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
csc(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix cosecant of a square matrix `A`.
```
cscd(x)
```

Compute the cosecant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
csch(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic cosecant of `x`.

```
csch(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic cosecant of square matrix `A`.
```
ctime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).ctime`.
```
cumprod(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product along the dimension `dim`. See also [`cumprod!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Int8[1 2 3; 4 5 6];

julia> cumprod(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2   3

julia> cumprod(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2    6
 4  20  120
```

```
cumprod(itr)
```

Cumulative product of an iterator.

See also [`cumprod!`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref), [`cumsum`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumprod` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumprod(fill(1//2, 3))
3-element Vector{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//2
 1//4
 1//8

julia> cumprod((1, 2, 1, 3, 1))
(1, 2, 2, 6, 6)

julia> cumprod("julia")
5-element Vector{String}:
 "j"
 "ju"
 "jul"
 "juli"
 "julia"
```
```
cumprod!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative product of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).

```
cumprod!(y::AbstractVector, x::AbstractVector)
```

Cumulative product of a vector `x`, storing the result in `y`. See also [`cumprod`](@ref).
```
cumsum(A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum along the dimension `dims`. See also [`cumsum!`](@ref) to use a preallocated output array, both for performance and to control the precision of the output (e.g. to avoid overflow).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> cumsum(a, dims=1)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 5  7  9

julia> cumsum(a, dims=2)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3   6
 4  9  15
```

!!! note
    The return array's `eltype` is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size  and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size. To preserve `eltype` of arrays with small signed or unsigned integer `accumulate(+, A)` should be used.

    ```jldoctest
    julia> cumsum(Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int64}:
     100
     128

    julia> accumulate(+,Int8[100, 28])
    2-element Vector{Int8}:
      100
     -128
    ```

    In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is `Int64[100, 128]`. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in `Int8[100, -128]`.


```
cumsum(itr)
```

Cumulative sum of an iterator.

See also [`accumulate`](@ref) to apply functions other than `+`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    `cumsum` on a non-array iterator requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cumsum(1:3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 6

julia> cumsum((true, false, true, false, true))
(1, 1, 2, 2, 3)

julia> cumsum(fill(1, 2) for i in 1:3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 1]
 [2, 2]
 [3, 3]
```
```
cumsum!(B, A; dims::Integer)
```

Cumulative sum of `A` along the dimension `dims`, storing the result in `B`. See also [`cumsum`](@ref).
```
current_exceptions(task::Task=current_task(); [backtrace::Bool=true])
```

Get the stack of exceptions currently being handled. For nested catch blocks there may be more than one current exception in which case the most recently thrown exception is last in the stack. The stack is returned as an `ExceptionStack` which is an AbstractVector of named tuples `(exception,backtrace)`. If `backtrace` is false, the backtrace in each pair will be set to `nothing`.

Explicitly passing `task` will return the current exception stack on an arbitrary task. This is useful for inspecting tasks which have failed due to uncaught exceptions.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function went by the experimental name `catch_stack()` in Julia 1.1–1.6, and had a plain Vector-of-tuples as a return type.

```
current_task()
```

Get the currently running [`Task`](@ref).
```
deepcopy(x)
```

Create a deep copy of `x`: everything is copied recursively, resulting in a fully independent object. For example, deep-copying an array produces a new array whose elements are deep copies of the original elements. Calling `deepcopy` on an object should generally have the same effect as serializing and then deserializing it.

While it isn't normally necessary, user-defined types can override the default `deepcopy` behavior by defining a specialized version of the function `deepcopy_internal(x::T, dict::IdDict)` (which shouldn't otherwise be used), where `T` is the type to be specialized for, and `dict` keeps track of objects copied so far within the recursion. Within the definition, `deepcopy_internal` should be used in place of `deepcopy`, and the `dict` variable should be updated as appropriate before returning.
```
deg2rad(x)
```

Convert `x` from degrees to radians.

See also: [`rad2deg`](@ref), [`sind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deg2rad(90)
1.5707963267948966
```
```
delete!(collection, key)
```

Delete the mapping for the given key in a collection, if any, and return the collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b")
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1

julia> delete!(d, "b") # d is left unchanged
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "a" => 1
```
```
deleteat!(a::Vector, i::Integer)
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

See also: [`delete!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 2)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
deleteat!(a::Vector, inds)
```

Remove the items at the indices given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap.

`inds` can be either an iterator or a collection of sorted and unique integer indices, or a boolean vector of the same length as `a` with `true` indicating entries to delete.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> deleteat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5

Denominator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> denominator(2//3)
3

julia> denominator(4)
1
```
```
detach(command)
```

Mark a command object so that it will be run in a new process group, allowing it to outlive the julia process, and not have Ctrl-C interrupts passed to it.
```
diff(A::AbstractVector)
diff(A::AbstractArray; dims::Integer)
```

Finite difference operator on a vector or a multidimensional array `A`. In the latter case the dimension to operate on needs to be specified with the `dims` keyword argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `diff` for arrays with dimension higher than 2 requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [2 4; 6 16]

```
digits([T<:Integer], n::Integer; base::T = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Return an array with element type `T` (default `Int`) of the digits of `n` in the given base, optionally padded with zeros to a specified size. More significant digits are at higher indices, such that `n == sum(digits[k]*base^(k-1) for k=1:length(digits))`.

See also [`ndigits`](@ref), [`digits!`](@ref), and for base 2 also [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> n == evalpoly(13, digits(n, base = 13))
true
```
```
digits!(array, n::Integer; base::Integer = 10)
```

Fills an array of the digits of `n` in the given base. More significant digits are at higher indices. If the array length is insufficient, the least significant digits are filled up to the array length. If the array length is excessive, the excess portion is filled with zeros.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> digits!([2, 2, 2, 2], 10, base = 2)

```
dirname(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Get the directory part of a path. Trailing characters ('/' or '\') in the path are counted as part of the path.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> dirname("/home/myuser")
"/home"

julia> dirname("/home/myuser/")
"/home/myuser"
```

See also [`basename`](@ref).
```
disable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Disable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function on the current task, for calling external code that may call julia code that is not interrupt safe. Intended to be called using `do` block syntax as follows:

```
disable_sigint() do
    # interrupt-unsafe code
    ...
end
```

This is not needed on worker threads (`Threads.threadid() != 1`) since the `InterruptException` will only be delivered to the master thread. External functions that do not call julia code or julia runtime automatically disable sigint during their execution.
```
diskstat(path=pwd())
```

Returns statistics in bytes about the disk that contains the file or directory pointed at by `path`. If no argument is passed, statistics about the disk that contains the current working directory are returned.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This method was added in Julia 1.8.

```
display(x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
display(mime, x)
display(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

Display `x` using the topmost applicable display in the display stack, typically using the richest supported multimedia output for `x`, with plain-text [`stdout`](@ref) output as a fallback. The `display(d, x)` variant attempts to display `x` on the given display `d` only, throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if `d` cannot display objects of this type.

In general, you cannot assume that `display` output goes to `stdout` (unlike [`print(x)`](@ref) or [`show(x)`](@ref)).  For example, `display(x)` may open up a separate window with an image. `display(x)` means "show `x` in the best way you can for the current output device(s)." If you want REPL-like text output that is guaranteed to go to `stdout`, use [`show(stdout, "text/plain", x)`](@ref) instead.

There are also two variants with a `mime` argument (a MIME type string, such as `"image/png"`), which attempt to display `x` using the requested MIME type *only*, throwing a `MethodError` if this type is not supported by either the display(s) or by `x`. With these variants, one can also supply the "raw" data in the requested MIME type by passing `x::AbstractString` (for MIME types with text-based storage, such as text/html or application/postscript) or `x::Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types).

To customize how instances of a type are displayed, overload [`show`](@ref) rather than `display`, as explained in the manual section on [custom pretty-printing](@ref man-custom-pretty-printing).
```
displayable(mime) -> Bool
displayable(d::AbstractDisplay, mime) -> Bool
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the given `mime` type (string) is displayable by any of the displays in the current display stack, or specifically by the display `d` in the second variant.
```
displaysize([io::IO]) -> (lines, columns)
```

Return the nominal size of the screen that may be used for rendering output to this `IO` object. If no input is provided, the environment variables `LINES` and `COLUMNS` are read. If those are not set, a default size of `(24, 80)` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> withenv("LINES" => 30, "COLUMNS" => 100) do
           displaysize()
       end
(30, 100)
```

To get your TTY size,

```julia-repl
julia> displaysize(stdout)
(34, 147)
```
```
div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

# Examples:

```
```
divrem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient and remainder from Euclidean division. Equivalent to `(div(x,y,r), rem(x,y,r))`. Equivalently, with the default value of `r`, this call is equivalent to `(x÷y, x%y)`.

See also: [`fldmod`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref).

```
```
download(url::AbstractString, [path::AbstractString = tempname()]) -> path
```

Download a file from the given url, saving it to the location `path`, or if not specified, a temporary path. Returns the path of the downloaded file.

!!! note
    Since Julia 1.6, this function is deprecated and is just a thin wrapper around `Downloads.download`. In new code, you should use that function directly instead of calling this.

```
dropdims(A; dims)
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with the dimensions specified by `dims` removed. `size(A,d)` must equal 1 for every `d` in `dims`, and repeated dimensions or numbers outside `1:ndims(A)` are forbidden.

The result shares the same underlying data as `A`, such that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

See also: [`reshape`](@ref), [`vec`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:4),(2,2,1,1))
2×2×1×1 Array{Int64, 4}:
[:, :, 1, 1] =

```
```
dump(x; maxdepth=8)
```

Show every part of the representation of a value. The depth of the output is truncated at `maxdepth`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

  y: Tuple{Int64, Int64}
```
```
eachcol(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the second dimension of matrix `A`, returning the columns as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref) and [`eachslice`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

julia> first(eachcol(a))
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:

 [1, 3]
 [2, 4]
```
```
eachindex(A...)
```

Create an iterable object for visiting each index of an `AbstractArray` `A` in an efficient manner. For array types that have opted into fast linear indexing (like `Array`), this is simply the range `1:length(A)`. For other array types, return a specialized Cartesian range to efficiently index into the array with indices specified for every dimension. For other iterables, including strings and dictionaries, return an iterator object supporting arbitrary index types (e.g. unevenly spaced or non-integer indices).

If you supply more than one `AbstractArray` argument, `eachindex` will create an iterable object that is fast for all arguments (a [`UnitRange`](@ref) if all inputs have fast linear indexing, a [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) otherwise). If the arrays have different sizes and/or dimensionalities, a `DimensionMismatch` exception will be thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> for i in eachindex(A) # linear indexing
           println(i)
       end

```
```
eachline(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
eachline(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Create an iterable `EachLine` object that will yield each line from an I/O stream or a file. Iteration calls [`readline`](@ref) on the stream argument repeatedly with `keep` passed through, determining whether trailing end-of-line characters are retained. When called with a file name, the file is opened once at the beginning of iteration and closed at the end. If iteration is interrupted, the file will be closed when the `EachLine` object is garbage collected.

To iterate over each line of a `String`, `eachline(IOBuffer(str))` can be used.

[`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) can be used on an `EachLine` object to read the lines in reverse order (for files, buffers, and other I/O streams supporting [`seek`](@ref)), and [`first`](@ref) or [`last`](@ref) can be used to extract the initial or final lines, respectively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n It has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> for line in eachline("my_file.txt")
           print(line)
       end
JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members.

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Julia 1.8 is required to use `Iterators.reverse` or `last` with `eachline` iterators.

```
eachmatch(r::Regex, s::AbstractString; overlap::Bool=false)
```

Search for all matches of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return an iterator over the matches. If `overlap` is `true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from distinct character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a.a"
r"a.a"

julia> m = eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a")
Base.RegexMatchIterator(r"a.a", "a1a2a3a", false)

julia> collect(m)
2-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")

julia> collect(eachmatch(rx, "a1a2a3a", overlap = true))
3-element Vector{RegexMatch}:
 RegexMatch("a1a")
 RegexMatch("a2a")
 RegexMatch("a3a")
```
```
eachrow(A::AbstractVecOrMat)
```

Create a generator that iterates over the first dimension of vector or matrix `A`, returning the rows as `AbstractVector` views.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> first(eachrow(a))
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1, :) with eltype Int64:

 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
```
```
eachslice(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Create a generator that iterates over dimensions `dims` of `A`, returning views that select all the data from the other dimensions in `A`.

Only a single dimension in `dims` is currently supported. Equivalent to `(view(A,:,:,...,i,:,: ...)) for i in axes(A, dims))`, where `i` is in position `dims`.

See also [`eachrow`](@ref), [`eachcol`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), and [`selectdim`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Example

```
```
eachsplit(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
eachsplit(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm` and return an iterator over the substrings.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`split`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `eachsplit` function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> collect(eachsplit(a, "."))
2-element Vector{SubString}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
eltype(type)
```

Determine the type of the elements generated by iterating a collection of the given `type`. For dictionary types, this will be a `Pair{KeyType,ValType}`. The definition `eltype(x) = eltype(typeof(x))` is provided for convenience so that instances can be passed instead of types. However the form that accepts a type argument should be defined for new types.

See also: [`keytype`](@ref), [`typeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eltype(fill(1f0, (2,2)))
Float32

julia> eltype(fill(0x1, (2,2)))
UInt8
```
```
empty(x::Tuple)
```

Returns an empty tuple, `()`.

```
empty(v::AbstractVector, [eltype])
```

Create an empty vector similar to `v`, optionally changing the `eltype`.

See also: [`empty!`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
Float64[]

julia> empty([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], String)
String[]
```

```
empty(a::AbstractDict, [index_type=keytype(a)], [value_type=valtype(a)])
```

Create an empty `AbstractDict` container which can accept indices of type `index_type` and values of type `value_type`. The second and third arguments are optional and default to the input's `keytype` and `valtype`, respectively. (If only one of the two types is specified, it is assumed to be the `value_type`, and the `index_type` we default to `keytype(a)`).

Custom `AbstractDict` subtypes may choose which specific dictionary type is best suited to return for the given index and value types, by specializing on the three-argument signature. The default is to return an empty `Dict`.
```
empty!(collection) -> collection
```

Remove all elements from a `collection`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> empty!(A);

julia> A
Dict{String, Int64}()
```
```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with `suffix`. If `suffix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the last character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`startswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("Sunday", "day")
true
```

```
endswith(suffix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument ends with `suffix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> endswith(y, suffix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(endswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `endswith(suffix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith_julia = endswith("Julia");

julia> endswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> endswith_julia("JuliaLang")
false
```

```
endswith(s::AbstractString, suffix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` ends with the regex pattern, `suffix`.

!!! note
    `endswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"...$", s)` is faster than `endswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`startswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> endswith("JuliaLang", r"Lang|Roberts")
true
```
```
enumerate(iter)
```

An iterator that yields `(i, x)` where `i` is a counter starting at 1, and `x` is the `i`th value from the given iterator. It's useful when you need not only the values `x` over which you are iterating, but also the number of iterations so far. Note that `i` may not be valid for indexing `iter`; it's also possible that `x != iter[i]`, if `iter` has indices that do not start at 1. See the `pairs(IndexLinear(), iter)` method if you want to ensure that `i` is an index.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ["a", "b", "c"];

julia> for (index, value) in enumerate(a)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
```
```
eof(stream) -> Bool
```

Test whether an I/O stream is at end-of-file. If the stream is not yet exhausted, this function will block to wait for more data if necessary, and then return `false`. Therefore it is always safe to read one byte after seeing `eof` return `false`. `eof` will return `false` as long as buffered data is still available, even if the remote end of a connection is closed.
```
eps(::Type{T}) where T<:AbstractFloat
eps()
```

Return the *machine epsilon* of the floating point type `T` (`T = Float64` by default). This is defined as the gap between 1 and the next largest value representable by `typeof(one(T))`, and is equivalent to `eps(one(T))`.  (Since `eps(T)` is a bound on the *relative error* of `T`, it is a "dimensionless" quantity like [`one`](@ref).)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps()
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(Float32)
1.1920929f-7

julia> 1.0 + eps()
1.0000000000000002

julia> 1.0 + eps()/2
1.0
```

```
eps(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the *unit in last place* (ulp) of `x`. This is the distance between consecutive representable floating point values at `x`. In most cases, if the distance on either side of `x` is different, then the larger of the two is taken, that is

```
eps(x) == max(x-prevfloat(x), nextfloat(x)-x)
```

The exceptions to this rule are the smallest and largest finite values (e.g. `nextfloat(-Inf)` and `prevfloat(Inf)` for [`Float64`](@ref)), which round to the smaller of the values.

The rationale for this behavior is that `eps` bounds the floating point rounding error. Under the default `RoundNearest` rounding mode, if $y$ is a real number and $x$ is the nearest floating point number to $y$, then

$$
|y-x| \leq \operatorname{eps}(x)/2.
$$

See also: [`nextfloat`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref), [`floatmax`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(1.0)
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(prevfloat(2.0))
2.220446049250313e-16

julia> eps(2.0)
4.440892098500626e-16

julia> x = prevfloat(Inf)      # largest finite Float64
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> x + eps(x)/2            # rounds up
Inf

julia> x + prevfloat(eps(x)/2) # rounds down

```

```
eps(::Type{DateTime}) -> Millisecond
eps(::Type{Date}) -> Day
eps(::Type{Time}) -> Nanosecond
eps(::TimeType) -> Period
```

Return the smallest unit value supported by the `TimeType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> eps(DateTime)
1 millisecond

julia> eps(Date)
1 day

julia> eps(Time)
1 nanosecond
```
```
error(message::AbstractString)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.

```
error(msg...)
```

Raise an `ErrorException` with the given message.
```
errormonitor(t::Task)
```

Print an error log to `stderr` if task `t` fails.
```
esc(e)
```

Only valid in the context of an [`Expr`](@ref) returned from a macro. Prevents the macro hygiene pass from turning embedded variables into gensym variables. See the [Macros](@ref man-macros) section of the Metaprogramming chapter of the manual for more details and examples.
```
escape_string(str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::AbstractString
escape_string(io, str::AbstractString[, esc]; keep = ())::Nothing
```

General escaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`.

Backslashes (`\`) are escaped with a double-backslash (`"\\"`). Non-printable characters are escaped either with their standard C escape codes, `"\0"` for NUL (if unambiguous), unicode code point (`"\u"` prefix) or hex (`"\x"` prefix).

The optional `esc` argument specifies any additional characters that should also be escaped by a prepending backslash (`"` is also escaped by default in the first form).

The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which are to be kept as they are. Notice that `esc` has precedence here.

See also [`unescape_string`](@ref) for the reverse operation.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The `keep` argument is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb")
"aaa\\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("aaa\nbbb"; keep = '\n')
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> escape_string("\xfe\xff") # invalid utf-8
"\\xfe\\xff"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0')) # unambiguous
"ℵ\\0"

julia> escape_string(string('\u2135','\0','0')) # \0 would be ambiguous
"ℵ\\x000"
```
```
evalfile(path::AbstractString, args::Vector{String}=String[])
```

Load the file using [`include`](@ref), evaluate all expressions, and return the value of the last one.
```
evalpoly(x, p)
```

Evaluate the polynomial $\sum_k x^{k-1} p[k]$ for the coefficients `p[1]`, `p[2]`, ...; that is, the coefficients are given in ascending order by power of `x`. Loops are unrolled at compile time if the number of coefficients is statically known, i.e. when `p` is a `Tuple`. This function generates efficient code using Horner's method if `x` is real, or using a Goertzel-like [^DK62] algorithm if `x` is complex.

exit(code=0)
```

Stop the program with an exit code. The default exit code is zero, indicating that the program completed successfully. In an interactive session, `exit()` can be called with the keyboard shortcut `^D`.
```
exp(x)
```

Compute the natural base exponential of `x`, in other words $ℯ^x$.

```
exp(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix exponential of `A`, defined by

$$
e^A = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{A^n}{n!}.
$$

For symmetric or Hermitian `A`, an eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, otherwise the scaling and squaring algorithm (see [^H05]) is chosen.

expanduser(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

On Unix systems, replace a tilde character at the start of a path with the current user's home directory.
```
expm1(x)
```

Accurately compute $e^x-1$. It avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small values of x.

# Examples

extrema(itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` element in a single pass, and return them as a 2-tuple.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). As a consequence, when `itr` is empty the returned `(mn, mx)` tuple will satisfy `mn ≥ mx`. When `init` is specified it may be used even for non-empty `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.8 or later.

julia> extrema([]; init = (Inf, -Inf))
(Inf, -Inf)
```

```
extrema(f, itr; [init]) -> (mn, mx)
```

Compute both the minimum `mn` and maximum `mx` of `f` applied to each element in `itr` and return them as a 2-tuple. Only one pass is made over `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a 2-tuple whose first and second elements are neutral elements for `min` and `max` respectively (i.e. which are greater/less than or equal to any other element). It is used for non-empty collections. Note: it implies that, for empty `itr`, the returned value `(mn, mx)` satisfies `mn ≥ mx` even though for non-empty `itr` it  satisfies `mn ≤ mx`.  This is a "paradoxical" but yet expected result.

factorial(n::Integer)
```

Factorial of `n`. If `n` is an [`Integer`](@ref), the factorial is computed as an integer (promoted to at least 64 bits). Note that this may overflow if `n` is not small, but you can use `factorial(big(n))` to compute the result exactly in arbitrary precision.

See also [`binomial`](@ref).

```
fd(stream)
```

Return the file descriptor backing the stream or file. Note that this function only applies to synchronous `File`'s and `IOStream`'s not to any of the asynchronous streams.
```
fdio([name::AbstractString, ]fd::Integer[, own::Bool=false]) -> IOStream
```

Create an [`IOStream`](@ref) object from an integer file descriptor. If `own` is `true`, closing this object will close the underlying descriptor. By default, an `IOStream` is closed when it is garbage collected. `name` allows you to associate the descriptor with a named file.
```
fetch(c::Channel)
```

Wait for and get the first available item from the channel. Does not remove the item. `fetch` is unsupported on an unbuffered (0-size) channel.

```
fetch(t::Task)
```

Wait for a Task to finish, then return its result value. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.

```
fetch(x::Future)
```

Wait for and get the value of a [`Future`](@ref). The fetched value is cached locally. Further calls to `fetch` on the same reference return the cached value. If the remote value is an exception, throws a [`RemoteException`](@ref) which captures the remote exception and backtrace.

```
fetch(c::RemoteChannel)
```

Wait for and get a value from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). Exceptions raised are the same as for a [`Future`](@ref). Does not remove the item fetched.
```
fieldcount(t::Type)
```

Get the number of fields that an instance of the given type would have. An error is thrown if the type is too abstract to determine this.
```
fieldname(x::DataType, i::Integer)
```

Get the name of field `i` of a `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fieldname(Rational, 1)
:num

julia> fieldname(Rational, 2)
:den
```
```
fieldnames(x::DataType)
```

Get a tuple with the names of the fields of a `DataType`.

```
fieldoffset(type, i)
```

The byte offset of field `i` of a type relative to the data start. For example, we could use it in the following manner to summarize information about a struct:

fieldtypes(T::Type)
```

The declared types of all fields in a composite DataType `T` as a tuple.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> fieldtypes(Foo)
(Int64, String)
```
```
filemode(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mode`.
```
filesize(path...)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).size`.
```
fill(value, dims::Tuple)
fill(value, dims...)
```

Create an array of size `dims` with every location set to `value`.

For example, `fill(1.0, (5,5))` returns a 5×5 array of floats, with `1.0` in every location of the array.

The dimension lengths `dims` may be specified as either a tuple or a sequence of arguments. An `N`-length tuple or `N` arguments following the `value` specify an `N`-dimensional array. Thus, a common idiom for creating a zero-dimensional array with its only location set to `x` is `fill(x)`.

Every location of the returned array is set to (and is thus [`===`](@ref) to) the `value` that was passed; this means that if the `value` is itself modified, all elements of the `fill`ed array will reflect that modification because they're *still* that very `value`. This is of no concern with `fill(1.0, (5,5))` as the `value` `1.0` is immutable and cannot itself be modified, but can be unexpected with mutable values like — most commonly — arrays.  For example, `fill([], 3)` places *the very same* empty array in all three locations of the returned vector:

```jldoctest
julia> v = fill([], 3)
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v[1] === v[2] === v[3]
true

julia> value = v[1]
Any[]

julia> push!(value, 867_5309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
 [8675309]
```

To create an array of many independent inner arrays, use a [comprehension](@ref man-comprehensions) instead. This creates a new and distinct array on each iteration of the loop:

```jldoctest
julia> v2 = [[] for _ in 1:3]
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 []
 []
 []

julia> v2[1] === v2[2] === v2[3]
false

julia> push!(v2[1], 8675309)
1-element Vector{Any}:
 8675309

julia> v2
3-element Vector{Vector{Any}}:
 [8675309]
 []
 []
```

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fill(1.0, (2,3))
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  1.0  1.0
 1.0  1.0  1.0

julia> fill(42)
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
42

julia> A = fill(zeros(2), 2) # sets both elements to the same [0.0, 0.0] vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [0.0, 0.0]
 [0.0, 0.0]

julia> A[1][1] = 42; # modifies the filled value to be [42.0, 0.0]

julia> A # both A[1] and A[2] are the very same vector
2-element Vector{Vector{Float64}}:
 [42.0, 0.0]
 [42.0, 0.0]
```
```
fill!(A, x)
```

Fill array `A` with the value `x`. If `x` is an object reference, all elements will refer to the same object. `fill!(A, Foo())` will return `A` filled with the result of evaluating `Foo()` once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,3)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  0.0

julia> fill!(A, 2.)
2×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  2.0  2.0
 2.0  2.0  2.0

julia> a = [1, 1, 1]; A = fill!(Vector{Vector{Int}}(undef, 3), a); a[1] = 2; A
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [2, 1, 1]
 [2, 1, 1]

3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 1
```
```
filter(f, a)
```

Return a copy of collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Support for `a` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.4.


See also: [`filter!`](@ref), [`Iterators.filter`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:10
1:10

julia> filter(isodd, a)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Return a copy of `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b")
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  2 => "b"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 1 entry:
  1 => "a"
```

```
filter(f, itr::SkipMissing{<:AbstractArray})
```

Return a vector similar to the array wrapped by the given `SkipMissing` iterator but with all missing elements and those for which `f` returns `false` removed.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1 2; missing 4]
2×2 Matrix{Union{Missing, Int64}}:
 1         2
  missing  4

julia> filter(isodd, skipmissing(x))
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
```
```
filter!(f, a)
```

Update collection `a`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed one argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> filter!(isodd, Vector(1:10))
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 5
 7
 9
```

```
filter!(f, d::AbstractDict)
```

Update `d`, removing elements for which `f` is `false`. The function `f` is passed `key=>value` pairs.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(1=>"a", 2=>"b", 3=>"c")
Dict{Int64, String} with 3 entries:
  2 => "b"
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"

julia> filter!(p->isodd(p.first), d)
Dict{Int64, String} with 2 entries:
  3 => "c"
  1 => "a"
```
```
finalize(x)
```

Immediately run finalizers registered for object `x`.
```
finalizer(f, x)
```

Register a function `f(x)` to be called when there are no program-accessible references to `x`, and return `x`. The type of `x` must be a `mutable struct`, otherwise the behavior of this function is unpredictable.

`f` must not cause a task switch, which excludes most I/O operations such as `println`. Using the `@async` macro (to defer context switching to outside of the finalizer) or `ccall` to directly invoke IO functions in C may be helpful for debugging purposes.

# Examples

```julia
finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    @async println("Finalizing $x.")
end

finalizer(my_mutable_struct) do x
    ccall(:jl_safe_printf, Cvoid, (Cstring, Cstring), "Finalizing %s.", repr(x))
end
```

A finalizer may be registered at object construction. In the following example note that we implicitly rely on the finalizer returning the newly created mutable struct `x`.

# Example

```julia
mutable struct MyMutableStruct
    bar
    function MyMutableStruct(bar)
        x = new(bar)
        f(t) = @async println("Finalizing $t.")
        finalizer(f, x)
    end
end
```
```
findall(f::Function, A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the indices or keys of `A` where `f(A[I])` returns `true`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = [1, 3, 4]

  :B => -1
  :C => 0

julia> findall(x -> x >= 0, d)
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :A
 :C

```

```
findall(A)
```

Return a vector `I` of the `true` indices or keys of `A`. If there are no such elements of `A`, return an empty array. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
findall(
    pattern::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern},
    string::AbstractString;
    overlap::Bool = false,
)
```

Return a `Vector{UnitRange{Int}}` of all the matches for `pattern` in `string`. Each element of the returned vector is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, like the return value of [`findnext`](@ref).

If `overlap=true`, the matching sequences are allowed to overlap indices in the original string, otherwise they must be from disjoint character ranges.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> findall("a", "apple")
1-element Vector{UnitRange{Int64}}:
 1:1

julia> findall("nana", "banana")
1-element Vector{UnitRange{Int64}}:

 5
```

```
findfirst(A)
```

Return the index or key of the first `true` value in `A`. Return `nothing` if no such value is found. To search for other kinds of values, pass a predicate as the first argument.

Indices or keys are of the same type as those returned by [`keys(A)`](@ref) and [`pairs(A)`](@ref).

```
findprev(pattern::AbstractString, string::AbstractString, start::Integer)
```

Find the previous occurrence of `pattern` in `string` starting at position `start`.

The return value is a range of indices where the matching sequence is found, such that `s[findprev(x, s, i)] == x`:

`findprev("substring", string, i)` == `start:stop` such that `string[start:stop] == "substring"` and `stop <= i`, or `nothing` if unmatched.

```

```

```

Get the first `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

See also: [`startswith`](@ref), [`Iterators.take`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```
firstindex(collection) -> Integer
firstindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the first index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the first index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[begin]` and `A[1, begin]` lower to `A[firstindex(A)]` and `A[1, firstindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`first`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> firstindex([1,2,4])
1

julia> firstindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
1
```
```
fld(x, y)
```

Largest integer less than or equal to `x/y`. Equivalent to `div(x, y, RoundDown)`.

See also [`div`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fld(7.3,5.5)
1.0

julia> fld.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -2  -1  -1  -1  0  0  0  1  1  1
```

Because `fld(x, y)` implements strictly correct floored rounding based on the true value of floating-point numbers, unintuitive situations can arise. For example:

```jldoctest
julia> fld(6.0,0.1)
59.0
julia> 6.0/0.1
60.0
julia> 6.0/big(0.1)
59.99999999999999666933092612453056361837965690217069245739573412231113406246995
```

What is happening here is that the true value of the floating-point number written as `0.1` is slightly larger than the numerical value 1/10 while `6.0` represents the number 6 precisely. Therefore the true value of `6.0 / 0.1` is slightly less than 60. When doing division, this is rounded to precisely `60.0`, but `fld(6.0, 0.1)` always takes the floor of the true value, so the result is `59.0`.
```
fld1(x, y)
```

Flooring division, returning a value consistent with `mod1(x,y)`

See also [`mod1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> fld1(x, y)
4

julia> x == fld(x, y) * y + mod(x, y)
true

julia> x == (fld1(x, y) - 1) * y + mod1(x, y)
true
```
```
fldmod(x, y)
```

The floored quotient and modulus after division. A convenience wrapper for `divrem(x, y, RoundDown)`. Equivalent to `(fld(x,y), mod(x,y))`.

See also: [`fld`](@ref), [`cld`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).
```
fldmod1(x, y)
```

Return `(fld1(x,y), mod1(x,y))`.

See also [`fld1`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref).
```
flipsign(x, y)
```

Return `x` with its sign flipped if `y` is negative. For example `abs(x) = flipsign(x,x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> flipsign(5, 3)
5

julia> flipsign(5, -3)
-5
```
```
float(x)
```

Convert a number or array to a floating point data type.

See also: [`complex`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref), [`convert`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(1:1000)
1.0:1.0:1000.0

julia> float(typemax(Int32))
2.147483647e9
```

```
float(T::Type)
```

Return an appropriate type to represent a value of type `T` as a floating point value. Equivalent to `typeof(float(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> float(Complex{Int})
ComplexF64 (alias for Complex{Float64})

julia> float(Int)
Float64
```
```
floatmax(T = Float64)
```

Return the largest finite number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

See also: [`typemax`](@ref), [`floatmin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmax(Float16)
Float16(6.55e4)

julia> floatmax(Float32)
3.4028235f38

julia> floatmax()
1.7976931348623157e308

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf
```
```
floatmin(T = Float64)
```

Return the smallest positive normal number representable by the floating-point type `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> floatmin(Float16)
Float16(6.104e-5)

julia> floatmin(Float32)
1.1754944f-38

julia> floatmin()
2.2250738585072014e-308
```
```
floor([T,] x)
floor(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
floor(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`floor(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` that is less than or equal to `x`.

`floor(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

```
floor(x::Period, precision::T) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` down to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> floor(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
30 minutes

julia> floor(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
1 day
```

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.

```
floor(dt::TimeType, p::Period) -> TimeType
```

Return the nearest `Date` or `DateTime` less than or equal to `dt` at resolution `p`.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `floor(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `floor(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> floor(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> floor(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> floor(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-06T00:00:00
```
```
flush(stream)
```

Commit all currently buffered writes to the given stream.
```
fma(x, y, z)
```

Computes `x*y+z` without rounding the intermediate result `x*y`. On some systems this is significantly more expensive than `x*y+z`. `fma` is used to improve accuracy in certain algorithms. See [`muladd`](@ref).
```
foldl(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

See also [`mapfoldl`](@ref), [`foldr`](@ref), [`accumulate`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldl(=>, 1:4)
((1 => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> foldl(=>, 1:4; init=0)
(((0 => 1) => 2) => 3) => 4

julia> accumulate(=>, (1,2,3,4))
(1, 1 => 2, (1 => 2) => 3, ((1 => 2) => 3) => 4)
```
```
foldr(op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`reduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity. If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> foldr(=>, 1:4)
1 => (2 => (3 => 4))

julia> foldr(=>, 1:4; init=0)
1 => (2 => (3 => (4 => 0)))
```
```
foreach(f, c...) -> Nothing
```

Call function `f` on each element of iterable `c`. For multiple iterable arguments, `f` is called elementwise, and iteration stops when any iterator is finished.

`foreach` should be used instead of [`map`](@ref) when the results of `f` are not needed, for example in `foreach(println, array)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tri = 1:3:7; res = Int[];

julia> foreach(x -> push!(res, x^2), tri)

julia> res
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
 16
 49

julia> foreach((x, y) -> println(x, " with ", y), tri, 'a':'z')
1 with a
4 with b
7 with c
```
```
frexp(val)
```

Return `(x,exp)` such that `x` has a magnitude in the interval $[1/2, 1)$ or 0, and `val` is equal to $x \times 2^{exp}$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> frexp(12.8)
(0.8, 4)
```
```
fullname(m::Module)
```

Get the fully-qualified name of a module as a tuple of symbols. For example,

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> fullname(Base.Iterators)
(:Base, :Iterators)

julia> fullname(Main)
(:Main,)
```
```
functionloc(m::Method)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a `Method` definition.

```
functionloc(f::Function, types)
```

Returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location of a generic `Function` definition.
```
gcd(x, y...)
```

Greatest common (positive) divisor (or zero if all arguments are zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcd(6, 9)
3

julia> gcd(6, -9)
3

julia> gcd(6, 0)
6

julia> gcd(0, 0)
0

julia> gcd(1//3, 2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, -2//3)
1//3

julia> gcd(1//3, 2)
1//3

julia> gcd(0, 0, 10, 15)
5
```
```
gcdx(a, b)
```

Computes the greatest common (positive) divisor of `a` and `b` and their Bézout coefficients, i.e. the integer coefficients `u` and `v` that satisfy $ua+vb = d = gcd(a, b)$. $gcdx(a, b)$ returns $(d, u, v)$.

The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> gcdx(12, 42)
(6, -3, 1)

julia> gcdx(240, 46)
(2, -9, 47)
```

!!! note
    Bézout coefficients are *not* uniquely defined. `gcdx` returns the minimal Bézout coefficients that are computed by the extended Euclidean algorithm. (Ref: D. Knuth, TAoCP, 2/e, p. 325, Algorithm X.) For signed integers, these coefficients `u` and `v` are minimal in the sense that $|u| < |y/d|$ and $|v| < |x/d|$. Furthermore, the signs of `u` and `v` are chosen so that `d` is positive. For unsigned integers, the coefficients `u` and `v` might be near their `typemax`, and the identity then holds only via the unsigned integers' modulo arithmetic.

```
gensym([tag])
```

Generates a symbol which will not conflict with other variable names.
```
get(collection, key, default)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or the given default value if no mapping for the key is present.

    # default value calculated here
    time()
end
```
```
get!(collection, key, default)

```

```
get!(f::Function, collection, key)
```

Return the value stored for the given key, or if no mapping for the key is present, store `key => f()`, and return `f()`.

This is intended to be called using `do` block syntax.

```
gethostname() -> AbstractString
```

Get the local machine's host name.
```
getindex(type[, elements...])
```

Construct a 1-d array of the specified type. This is usually called with the syntax `Type[]`. Element values can be specified using `Type[a,b,c,...]`.

# Examples

3-element Vector{Int8}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> getindex(Int8, 1, 2, 3)
3-element Vector{Int8}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
getindex(collection, key...)
```

Retrieve the value(s) stored at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...]` is converted by the compiler to `getindex(a, i, j, ...)`.

See also [`get`](@ref), [`keys`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Dict("a" => 1, "b" => 2)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:

```

```
getindex(A, inds...)
```

Return a subset of array `A` as specified by `inds`, where each `ind` may be, for example, an `Int`, an [`AbstractRange`](@ref), or a [`Vector`](@ref). See the manual section on [array indexing](@ref man-array-indexing) for details.

subtree = tree["test"]
runtests = subtree["runtests.jl"]
```
```
getkey(collection, key, default)

Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> getkey(D, 'a', 1)

getpid() -> Int32
```

Get Julia's process ID.
```
getproperty(value, name::Symbol)
getproperty(value, name::Symbol, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyType
           x
       end

julia> function Base.getproperty(obj::MyType, sym::Symbol)
           if sym === :special

julia> hasfield(Foo, :x)
false
```
```
hash(x[, h::UInt]) -> UInt
```

Compute an integer hash code such that `isequal(x,y)` implies `hash(x)==hash(y)`. The optional second argument `h` is a hash code to be mixed with the result.

New types should implement the 2-argument form, typically by calling the 2-argument `hash` method recursively in order to mix hashes of the contents with each other (and with `h`). Typically, any type that implements `hash` should also implement its own [`==`](@ref) (hence [`isequal`](@ref)) to guarantee the property mentioned above. Types supporting subtraction (operator `-`) should also implement [`widen`](@ref), which is required to hash values inside heterogeneous arrays.

See also: [`objectid`](@ref), [`Dict`](@ref), [`Set`](@ref).
```
haskey(collection, key) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection has a mapping for a given `key`.

hasmethod(f, t::Type{<:Tuple}[, kwnames]; world=get_world_counter()) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the given generic function has a method matching the given `Tuple` of argument types with the upper bound of world age given by `world`.

If a tuple of keyword argument names `kwnames` is provided, this also checks whether the method of `f` matching `t` has the given keyword argument names. If the matching method accepts a variable number of keyword arguments, e.g. with `kwargs...`, any names given in `kwnames` are considered valid. Otherwise the provided names must be a subset of the method's keyword arguments.

See also [`applicable`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Providing keyword argument names requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> hasmethod(length, Tuple{Array})
true

julia> f(; oranges=0) = oranges;

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:oranges,))
true

julia> hasmethod(f, Tuple{}, (:apples, :bananas))
false

julia> g(; xs...) = 4;

julia> hasmethod(g, Tuple{}, (:a, :b, :c, :d))  # g accepts arbitrary kwargs
true
```
```
hasproperty(x, s::Symbol)
```

Return a boolean indicating whether the object `x` has `s` as one of its own properties.

hcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 2. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(hcat, x)`.

```
hex2bytes(itr)
```

Given an iterable `itr` of ASCII codes for a sequence of hexadecimal digits, returns a `Vector{UInt8}` of bytes  corresponding to the binary representation: each successive pair of hexadecimal digits in `itr` gives the value of one byte in the return vector.

The length of `itr` must be even, and the returned array has half of the length of `itr`. See also [`hex2bytes!`](@ref) for an in-place version, and [`bytes2hex`](@ref) for the inverse.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling `hex2bytes` with iterators producing `UInt8` values requires Julia 1.7 or later. In earlier versions, you can `collect` the iterator before calling `hex2bytes`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = string(12345, base = 16)
"3039"

julia> hex2bytes(s)
2-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x30
 0x39

julia> a = b"01abEF"
6-element Base.CodeUnits{UInt8, String}:
 0x30
 0x31
 0x61
 0x62
 0x45
 0x46

julia> hex2bytes(a)
3-element Vector{UInt8}:
 0x01
 0xab
 0xef
```
```
hex2bytes!(dest::AbstractVector{UInt8}, itr)
```

Convert an iterable `itr` of bytes representing a hexadecimal string to its binary representation, similar to [`hex2bytes`](@ref) except that the output is written in-place to `dest`. The length of `dest` must be half the length of `itr`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Calling hex2bytes! with iterators producing UInt8 requires version 1.7. In earlier versions, you can collect the iterable before calling instead.

```
homedir() -> String
```

Return the current user's home directory.

!!! note
    `homedir` determines the home directory via `libuv`'s `uv_os_homedir`. For details (for example on how to specify the home directory via environment variables), see the [`uv_os_homedir` documentation](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/misc.html#c.uv_os_homedir).

```
htol(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Little-endian.
```
hton(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from that used by the Host to Network byte order (big-endian).
```
hvcat(rows::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, values...)
```

Horizontal and vertical concatenation in one call. This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument specifies the number of arguments to concatenate in each block row.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

julia> [a b c; d e f]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> hvcat((3,3), a,b,c,d,e,f)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> [a b; c d; e f]
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6

julia> hvcat((2,2,2), a,b,c,d,e,f)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
 5  6
```

If the first argument is a single integer `n`, then all block rows are assumed to have `n` block columns.
```
hvncat(dim::Int, row_first, values...)
hvncat(dims::Tuple{Vararg{Int}}, row_first, values...)
hvncat(shape::Tuple{Vararg{Tuple}}, row_first, values...)
```

Horizontal, vertical, and n-dimensional concatenation of many `values` in one call.

This function is called for block matrix syntax. The first argument either specifies the shape of the concatenation, similar to `hvcat`, as a tuple of tuples, or the dimensions that specify the key number of elements along each axis, and is used to determine the output dimensions. The `dims` form is more performant, and is used by default when the concatenation operation has the same number of elements along each axis (e.g., [a b; c d;;; e f ; g h]). The `shape` form is used when the number of elements along each axis is unbalanced (e.g., [a b ; c]). Unbalanced syntax needs additional validation overhead. The `dim` form is an optimization for concatenation along just one dimension. `row_first` indicates how `values` are ordered. The meaning of the first and second elements of `shape` are also swapped based on `row_first`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a, b, c, d, e, f = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

```
identity(x)
```

The identity function. Returns its argument.

See also: [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), and [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg)'s `I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> identity("Well, what did you expect?")
"Well, what did you expect?"
```
```
ifelse(condition::Bool, x, y)
```

Return `x` if `condition` is `true`, otherwise return `y`. This differs from `?` or `if` in that it is an ordinary function, so all the arguments are evaluated first. In some cases, using `ifelse` instead of an `if` statement can eliminate the branch in generated code and provide higher performance in tight loops.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ifelse(1 > 2, 1, 2)
2
```
```
ignorestatus(command)
```

Mark a command object so that running it will not throw an error if the result code is non-zero.
```
imag(z)
```

Return the imaginary part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`conj`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`adjoint`](@ref), [`angle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag(1 + 3im)
3
```

```
imag(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the imaginary part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `imag.(A)`, except that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> imag([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 0
 2
 4

julia> imag(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:

```
```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1:3:20
1:3:19

include_dependency(path::AbstractString)
```

In a module, declare that the file specified by `path` (relative or absolute) is a dependency for precompilation; that is, the module will need to be recompiled if this file changes.

This is only needed if your module depends on a file that is not used via [`include`](@ref). It has no effect outside of compilation.
```
include_string([mapexpr::Function,] m::Module, code::AbstractString, filename::AbstractString="string")
```

Like [`include`](@ref), except reads code from the given string rather than from a file.

The optional first argument `mapexpr` can be used to transform the included code before it is evaluated: for each parsed expression `expr` in `code`, the `include_string` function actually evaluates `mapexpr(expr)`.  If it is omitted, `mapexpr` defaults to [`identity`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Julia 1.5 is required for passing the `mapexpr` argument.

```
indexin(a, b)
```

Return an array containing the first index in `b` for each value in `a` that is a member of `b`. The output array contains `nothing` wherever `a` is not a member of `b`.

See also: [`sortperm`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'a'];

```
```
insert!(a::Vector, index::Integer, item)
```

Insert an `item` into `a` at the given `index`. `index` is the index of `item` in the resulting `a`.

See also: [`push!`](@ref), [`replace`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

# Examples

  "here"
 3
 4

```
```
insorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given sorted collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values of the collection according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order, see [`sort`](@ref) for the keywords.

See also [`in`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> insorted(4, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # single match
true

julia> insorted(5, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # multiple matches

false

julia> insorted(0, [1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7]) # no match
false
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    `insorted` was added in Julia 1.6.

```
instances(T::Type)
```

Return a collection of all instances of the given type, if applicable. Mostly used for enumerated types (see `@enum`).

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> @enum Color red blue green

julia> instances(Color)
(red, blue, green)
```
```
intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    As of Julia 1.8 intersect returns a result with the eltype of the type-promoted eltypes of the two inputs


# Examples

Set{Float64} with 1 element:
  2.0
```
```
intersect!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Intersect all passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.
```
inv(x)
```

Return the multiplicative inverse of `x`, such that `x*inv(x)` or `inv(x)*x` yields [`one(x)`](@ref) (the multiplicative identity) up to roundoff errors.

If `x` is a number, this is essentially the same as `one(x)/x`, but for some types `inv(x)` may be slightly more efficient.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> inv(2)
0.5

julia> inv(1 + 2im)
0.2 - 0.4im

julia> inv(1 + 2im) * (1 + 2im)

julia> inv(2//3)
3//2
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `inv(::Missing)` requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
inv(M)
```

Matrix inverse. Computes matrix `N` such that `M * N = I`, where `I` is the identity matrix. Computed by solving the left-division `N = M \ I`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> M = [2 5; 1 3]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  5
 1  3

julia> N = inv(M)
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:

 -1.0   2.0

julia> M*N == N*M == Matrix(I, 2, 2)
true
```
```
invmod(n, m)
```

Take the inverse of `n` modulo `m`: `y` such that $n y = 1 \pmod m$, and $div(y,m) = 0$. This will throw an error if $m = 0$, or if $gcd(n,m) \neq 1$.

2

julia> invmod(5, 6)
5
```

Binding `invokelatest` does not exist.
```
invperm(v)
```

Return the inverse permutation of `v`. If `B = A[v]`, then `A == B[invperm(v)]`.

See also [`sortperm`](@ref), [`invpermute!`](@ref), [`isperm`](@ref), [`permutedims`](@ref).

# Examples

isabspath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path is absolute (begins at the root directory).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabspath("/home")
true

julia> isabspath("home")
false
```
```
isabstracttype(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` was declared as an abstract type (i.e. using the `abstract` keyword).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isabstracttype(AbstractArray)
true

julia> isabstracttype(Vector)
false
```
```
isapprox(x, y; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : √eps, nans::Bool=false[, norm::Function])
```

Inexact equality comparison. Two numbers compare equal if their relative distance *or* their absolute distance is within tolerance bounds: `isapprox` returns `true` if `norm(x-y) <= max(atol, rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y)))`. The default `atol` is zero and the default `rtol` depends on the types of `x` and `y`. The keyword argument `nans` determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).

For real or complex floating-point values, if an `atol > 0` is not specified, `rtol` defaults to the square root of [`eps`](@ref) of the type of `x` or `y`, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significant digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an `atol > 0` is supplied, `rtol` defaults to zero.

The `norm` keyword defaults to `abs` for numeric `(x,y)` and to `LinearAlgebra.norm` for arrays (where an alternative `norm` choice is sometimes useful). When `x` and `y` are arrays, if `norm(x-y)` is not finite (i.e. `±Inf` or `NaN`), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of `x` and `y` are approximately equal component-wise.

The binary operator `≈` is equivalent to `isapprox` with the default arguments, and `x ≉ y` is equivalent to `!isapprox(x,y)`.

Note that `x ≈ 0` (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to `x == 0` since the default `atol` is `0`.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate `atol` (or use `norm(x) ≤ atol`) or rearrange your code (e.g. use `x ≈ y` rather than `x - y ≈ 0`).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero `atol` automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the "units") of your problem: for example, in `x - y ≈ 0`, `atol=1e-9` is an absurdly small tolerance if `x` is the [radius of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius) in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if `x` is the [radius of a Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) in meters.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Passing the `norm` keyword argument when comparing numeric (non-array) arguments requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```

```
isapprox(x; kwargs...) / ≈(x; kwargs...)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using `≈`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y ≈ x`.

The keyword arguments supported here are the same as those in the 2-argument `isapprox`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This method requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
isascii(c::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character belongs to the ASCII character set, or whether this is true for all elements of a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isascii('a')
true

julia> isascii('α')
false

julia> isascii("abc")
true

julia> isascii("αβγ")
false
```

For example, `isascii` can be used as a predicate function for [`filter`](@ref) or [`replace`](@ref) to remove or replace non-ASCII characters, respectively:

```jldoctest
julia> filter(isascii, "abcdeγfgh") # discard non-ASCII chars
"abcdefgh"

julia> replace("abcdeγfgh", !isascii=>' ') # replace non-ASCII chars with spaces
"abcde fgh"
```
```
isassigned(array, i) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given array has a value associated with index `i`. Return `false` if the index is out of bounds, or has an undefined reference.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 5)
true

julia> isassigned(rand(3, 3), 3 * 3 + 1)
false

julia> mutable struct Foo end

julia> v = similar(rand(3), Foo)
3-element Vector{Foo}:
 #undef
 #undef
 #undef

julia> isassigned(v, 1)
false
```

```
isassigned(ref::RefValue) -> Bool
```

Test whether the given [`Ref`](@ref) is associated with a value. This is always true for a [`Ref`](@ref) of a bitstype object. Return `false` if the reference is undefined.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ref = Ref{Function}()
Base.RefValue{Function}(#undef)

julia> isassigned(ref)
false

julia> ref[] = (foobar(x) = x)
foobar (generic function with 1 method)

julia> isassigned(ref)
true

julia> isassigned(Ref{Int}())
true
```
```
isbits(x)
```

Return `true` if `x` is an instance of an [`isbitstype`](@ref) type.
```
isbitstype(T)
```

Return `true` if type `T` is a "plain data" type, meaning it is immutable and contains no references to other values, only `primitive` types and other `isbitstype` types. Typical examples are numeric types such as [`UInt8`](@ref), [`Float64`](@ref), and [`Complex{Float64}`](@ref). This category of types is significant since they are valid as type parameters, may not track [`isdefined`](@ref) / [`isassigned`](@ref) status, and have a defined layout that is compatible with C.

See also [`isbits`](@ref), [`isprimitivetype`](@ref), [`ismutable`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isbitstype(Complex{Float64})
true

julia> isbitstype(Complex)
false
```
```

```

Return `true` if `path` is a block device, `false` otherwise.
```
ischardev(path) -> Bool
```

julia> iscntrl('a')
false
```
```
isconcretetype(T)

true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex})
true

julia> isconcretetype(Vector{Complex{Float32}})

Return `true` if `path` is a directory, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest

false
```

See also [`isfile`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isdirpath(path::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a path refers to a directory (for example, ends with a path separator).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdirpath("/home")
false

julia> isdirpath("/home/")
true
```
```
isdisjoint(a, b) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the collections `a` and `b` are disjoint. Equivalent to `isempty(a ∩ b)` but more efficient when possible.

See also: [`intersect`](@ref), [`isempty`](@ref), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdisjoint([1, 2], [2, 3, 4])
false

julia> isdisjoint([3, 1], [2, 4])
true
```
```
isdispatchtuple(T)
```

Determine whether type `T` is a tuple "leaf type", meaning it could appear as a type signature in dispatch and has no subtypes (or supertypes) which could appear in a call.
```
isempty(collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a collection is empty (has no elements).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isempty([])
true

julia> isempty([1 2 3])
false
```

```
isempty(condition)
```

Return `true` if no tasks are waiting on the condition, `false` otherwise.
```
isequal(x, y)
```

Similar to [`==`](@ref), except for the treatment of floating point numbers and of missing values. `isequal` treats all floating-point `NaN` values as equal to each other, treats `-0.0` as unequal to `0.0`, and [`missing`](@ref) as equal to `missing`. Always returns a `Bool` value.

`isequal` is an equivalence relation - it is reflexive (`===` implies `isequal`), symmetric (`isequal(a, b)` implies `isequal(b, a)`) and transitive (`isequal(a, b)` and `isequal(b, c)` implies `isequal(a, c)`).

# Implementation

The default implementation of `isequal` calls `==`, so a type that does not involve floating-point values generally only needs to define `==`.

`isequal` is the comparison function used by hash tables (`Dict`). `isequal(x,y)` must imply that `hash(x) == hash(y)`.

This typically means that types for which a custom `==` or `isequal` method exists must implement a corresponding [`hash`](@ref) method (and vice versa). Collections typically implement `isequal` by calling `isequal` recursively on all contents.

Furthermore, `isequal` is linked with [`isless`](@ref), and they work together to define a fixed total ordering, where exactly one of `isequal(x, y)`, `isless(x, y)`, or `isless(y, x)` must be `true` (and the other two `false`).

Scalar types generally do not need to implement `isequal` separate from `==`, unless they represent floating-point numbers amenable to a more efficient implementation than that provided as a generic fallback (based on `isnan`, `signbit`, and `==`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isequal([1., NaN], [1., NaN])
true

julia> [1., NaN] == [1., NaN]
false

julia> 0.0 == -0.0
true

julia> isequal(0.0, -0.0)
false

julia> missing == missing
missing

julia> isequal(missing, missing)
true
```

```
isequal(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`isequal`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> isequal(y, x)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(isequal)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.
```
iseven(x::Number) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `x` is an even integer (that is, an integer divisible by 2), and `false` otherwise.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Non-`Integer` arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iseven(9)
false

julia> iseven(10)
true
```
```
isfifo(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a FIFO, `false` otherwise.
```
isfile(path) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if `path` is a regular file, `false` otherwise.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfile(homedir())
false

julia> f = open("test_file.txt", "w");

julia> isfile(f)
true

julia> close(f); rm("test_file.txt")
```

See also [`isdir`](@ref) and [`ispath`](@ref).
```
isfinite(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is finite.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isfinite(5)
true

julia> isfinite(NaN32)
false
```
```
isimmutable(v) -> Bool
```

!!! warning
    Consider using `!ismutable(v)` instead, as `isimmutable(v)` will be replaced by `!ismutable(v)` in a future release. (Since Julia 1.5)


Return `true` iff value `v` is immutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isimmutable(1)
true

julia> isimmutable([1,2])
false
```
```
isinf(f) -> Bool
```

Test whether a number is infinite.

See also: [`Inf`](@ref), [`iszero`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).
```
isinteger(x) -> Bool
```

Test whether `x` is numerically equal to some integer.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isinteger(4.0)
true
```
```
isinteractive() -> Bool
```

Determine whether Julia is running an interactive session.
```
isless(t1::Tuple, t2::Tuple)
```

Returns true when t1 is less than t2 in lexicographic order.

```
isless(x, y)
```

Test whether `x` is less than `y`, according to a fixed total order (defined together with [`isequal`](@ref)). `isless` is not defined on all pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, if it is defined, it is expected to satisfy the following:

  * If `isless(x, y)` is defined, then so is `isless(y, x)` and `isequal(x, y)`, and exactly one of those three yields `true`.
  * The relation defined by `isless` is transitive, i.e., `isless(x, y) && isless(y, z)` implies `isless(x, z)`.

Values that are normally unordered, such as `NaN`, are ordered after regular values. [`missing`](@ref) values are ordered last.

This is the default comparison used by [`sort`](@ref).

# Implementation

Non-numeric types with a total order should implement this function. Numeric types only need to implement it if they have special values such as `NaN`. Types with a partial order should implement [`<`](@ref). See the documentation on [Alternate orderings](@ref) for how to define alternate ordering methods that can be used in sorting and related functions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless(1, 3)
true

julia> isless("Red", "Blue")
false
```

```
isless(A::AbstractVector, B::AbstractVector)
```

Returns true when `A` is less than `B` in lexicographic order.

```
isless(a::AbstractString, b::AbstractString) -> Bool
```

Test whether string `a` comes before string `b` in alphabetical order (technically, in lexicographical order by Unicode code points).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isless("a", "b")
true

julia> isless("β", "α")
false

julia> isless("a", "a")
false
```

Return `true` if `path` is a mount point, `false` otherwise.
```
ismutable(v) -> Bool
```

Return `true` if and only if value `v` is mutable.  See [Mutable Composite Types](@ref) for a discussion of immutability. Note that this function works on values, so if you give it a type, it will tell you that a value of `DataType` is mutable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isodd(9)
true

julia> isodd(10)

```
```
isone(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == one(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether `x` is an identity matrix.

true
```
```
isopen(object) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an object - such as a stream or timer – is not yet closed. Once an object is closed, it will never produce a new event. However, since a closed stream may still have data to read in its buffer, use [`eof`](@ref) to check for the ability to read data. Use the `FileWatching` package to be notified when a stream might be writable or readable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = open("my_file.txt", "w+");

julia> isopen(io)
true

julia> close(io)

julia> isopen(io)
false
```
```
ispath(path) -> Bool

```
```
ispow2(n::Number) -> Bool

       end
true

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isreadonly(io) -> Bool
```

Determine whether a stream is read-only.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> isreadonly(io)
true

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> isreadonly(io)
false
```
```
isready(c::Channel)
```

Determine whether a [`Channel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Returns immediately, does not block.

For unbuffered channels returns `true` if there are tasks waiting on a [`put!`](@ref).

```
isready(rr::Future)
```

Determine whether a [`Future`](@ref) has a value stored to it.

If the argument `Future` is owned by a different node, this call will block to wait for the answer. It is recommended to wait for `rr` in a separate task instead or to use a local [`Channel`](@ref) as a proxy:

```julia
p = 1
f = Future(p)
errormonitor(@async put!(f, remotecall_fetch(long_computation, p)))
isready(f)  # will not block
```

```
isready(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Determine whether a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) has a value stored to it. Note that this function can cause race conditions, since by the time you receive its result it may no longer be true. However, it can be safely used on a [`Future`](@ref) since they are assigned only once.
```

```
```
istextmime(m::MIME)

```
isvalid(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Bool
```

Predicate indicating whether the given index is the start of the encoding of a character in `s` or not. If `isvalid(s, i)` is true then `s[i]` will return the character whose encoding starts at that index, if it's false, then `s[i]` will raise an invalid index error or a bounds error depending on if `i` is in bounds. In order for `isvalid(s, i)` to be an O(1) function, the encoding of `s` must be [self-synchronizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-synchronizing_code). This is a basic assumption of Julia's generic string support.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`iterate`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref), [`length`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγdef";

julia> isvalid(str, 1)
true

julia> str[1]
'α': Unicode U+03B1 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)

julia> isvalid(str, 2)
false

julia> str[2]
ERROR: StringIndexError: invalid index [2], valid nearby indices [1]=>'α', [3]=>'β'
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
isvalid(value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for its type, which currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String` or `SubString{String}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char(0xd800))
false

julia> isvalid(SubString(String(UInt8[0xfe,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80,0x80]),1,2))
false

julia> isvalid(Char(0xd799))
true
```

```
isvalid(T, value) -> Bool
```

Returns `true` if the given value is valid for that type. Types currently can be either `AbstractChar` or `String`. Values for `AbstractChar` can be of type `AbstractChar` or [`UInt32`](@ref). Values for `String` can be of that type, `SubString{String}`, `Vector{UInt8}`, or a contiguous subarray thereof.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd800)
false

julia> isvalid(String, SubString("thisisvalid",1,5))
true

julia> isvalid(Char, 0xd799)
true
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Support for subarray values was added in Julia 1.6.

```
iswritable(io) -> Bool
```

Return `false` if the specified IO object is not writable.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
           print(io, "Hello world!");
           iswritable(io)
       end
true

julia> open("myfile.txt", "r") do io
           iswritable(io)
       end
false

julia> rm("myfile.txt")
```
```
isxdigit(c::AbstractChar) -> Bool
```

Test whether a character is a valid hexadecimal digit. Note that this does not include `x` (as in the standard `0x` prefix).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isxdigit('a')
true

julia> isxdigit('x')
false
```
```
iszero(x)
```

Return `true` if `x == zero(x)`; if `x` is an array, this checks whether all of the elements of `x` are zero.

See also: [`isone`](@ref), [`isinteger`](@ref), [`isfinite`](@ref), [`isnan`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> iszero(0.0)
true

julia> iszero([1, 9, 0])
false

julia> iszero([false, 0, 0])
true
```
```
iterate(iter [, state]) -> Union{Nothing, Tuple{Any, Any}}
```

Advance the iterator to obtain the next element. If no elements remain, `nothing` should be returned. Otherwise, a 2-tuple of the next element and the new iteration state should be returned.

```
iterate(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Union{Tuple{<:AbstractChar, Int}, Nothing}
```

Return a tuple of the character in `s` at index `i` with the index of the start of the following character in `s`. This is the key method that allows strings to be iterated, yielding a sequences of characters. If `i` is out of bounds in `s` then a bounds error is raised. The `iterate` function, as part of the iteration protocol may assume that `i` is the start of a character in `s`.

See also [`getindex`](@ref), [`checkbounds`](@ref).
```
join([io::IO,] iterator [, delim [, last]])
```

Join any `iterator` into a single string, inserting the given delimiter (if any) between adjacent items.  If `last` is given, it will be used instead of `delim` between the last two items.  Each item of `iterator` is converted to a string via `print(io::IOBuffer, x)`. If `io` is given, the result is written to `io` rather than returned as a `String`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> join(["apples", "bananas", "pineapples"], ", ", " and ")
"apples, bananas and pineapples"

julia> join([1,2,3,4,5])
"12345"
```
```
joinpath(parts::AbstractString...) -> String
joinpath(parts::Vector{AbstractString}) -> String
joinpath(parts::Tuple{AbstractString}) -> String
```

Join path components into a full path. If some argument is an absolute path or (on Windows) has a drive specification that doesn't match the drive computed for the join of the preceding paths, then prior components are dropped.

Note on Windows since there is a current directory for each drive, `joinpath("c:", "foo")` represents a path relative to the current directory on drive "c:" so this is equal to "c:foo", not "c:\foo". Furthermore, `joinpath` treats this as a non-absolute path and ignores the drive letter casing, hence `joinpath("C:\A","c:b") = "C:\A\b"`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath("/home/myuser", "example.jl")
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```

```jldoctest
julia> joinpath(["/home/myuser", "example.jl"])
"/home/myuser/example.jl"
```
```
keepat!(a::Vector, inds)
keepat!(a::BitVector, inds)
```

Remove the items at all the indices which are not given by `inds`, and return the modified `a`. Items which are kept are shifted to fill the resulting gaps.

`inds` must be an iterator of sorted and unique integer indices. See also [`deleteat!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    This function is available as of Julia 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keepat!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 1:2:5)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 4
 2
```

```
keepat!(a::Vector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
keepat!(a::BitVector, m::AbstractVector{Bool})
```

The in-place version of logical indexing `a = a[m]`. That is, `keepat!(a, m)` on vectors of equal length `a` and `m` will remove all elements from `a` for which `m` at the corresponding index is `false`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [:a, :b, :c];

julia> keepat!(a, [true, false, true])
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c

julia> a
2-element Vector{Symbol}:
 :a
 :c
```
```
keys(a::AbstractArray)
```

Return an efficient array describing all valid indices for `a` arranged in the shape of `a` itself.

They keys of 1-dimensional arrays (vectors) are integers, whereas all other N-dimensional arrays use [`CartesianIndex`](@ref) to describe their locations.  Often the special array types [`LinearIndices`](@ref) and [`CartesianIndices`](@ref) are used to efficiently represent these arrays of integers and `CartesianIndex`es, respectively.

Note that the `keys` of an array might not be the most efficient index type; for maximum performance use  [`eachindex`](@ref) instead.

```
keys(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values (e.g. arrays and dictionaries), return an iterator over the keys.

```
keys(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all keys in a dictionary. `collect(keys(a))` returns an array of keys. When the keys are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(keys(D))
2-element Vector{Char}:
 'a': ASCII/Unicode U+0061 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
 'b': ASCII/Unicode U+0062 (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

```
keys(m::RegexMatch) -> Vector
```

Return a vector of keys for all capture groups of the underlying regex. A key is included even if the capture group fails to match. That is, `idx` will be in the return value even if `m[idx] == nothing`.

Unnamed capture groups will have integer keys corresponding to their index. Named capture groups will have string keys.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method was added in Julia 1.6


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keys(match(r"(?<hour>\d+):(?<minute>\d+)(am|pm)?", "11:30"))
3-element Vector{Any}:
  "hour"
  "minute"
 3
```
```
keytype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
keytype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the key type of an array. This is equal to the `eltype` of the result of `keys(...)`, and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype([1, 2, 3]) == Int
true

julia> keytype([1 2; 3 4])
CartesianIndex{2}
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
keytype(type)
```

Get the key type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> keytype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
Int32
```
```
kill(p::Process, signum=Base.SIGTERM)
```

Send a signal to a process. The default is to terminate the process. Returns successfully if the process has already exited, but throws an error if killing the process failed for other reasons (e.g. insufficient permissions).

```
kill(manager::ClusterManager, pid::Int, config::WorkerConfig)
```

Implemented by cluster managers. It is called on the master process, by [`rmprocs`](@ref). It should cause the remote worker specified by `pid` to exit. `kill(manager::ClusterManager.....)` executes a remote `exit()` on `pid`.
```
kron(A, B)
```

Kronecker tensor product of two vectors or two matrices.

For real vectors `v` and `w`, the Kronecker product is related to the outer product by `kron(v,w) == vec(w * transpose(v))` or `w * transpose(v) == reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))`. Note how the ordering of `v` and `w` differs on the left and right of these expressions (due to column-major storage). For complex vectors, the outer product `w * v'` also differs by conjugation of `v`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> B = [im 1; 1 -im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im
 1+0im  0-1im

julia> kron(A, B)
4×4 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 0+1im  1+0im  0+2im  2+0im
 1+0im  0-1im  2+0im  0-2im
 0+3im  3+0im  0+4im  4+0im
 3+0im  0-3im  4+0im  0-4im

julia> v = [1, 2]; w = [3, 4, 5];

julia> w*transpose(v)
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10

julia> reshape(kron(v,w), (length(w), length(v)))
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3   6
 4   8
 5  10
```
```
kron!(C, A, B)
```

`kron!` is the in-place version of [`kron`](@ref). Computes `kron(A, B)` and stores the result in `C` overwriting the existing value of `C`.

!!! tip
    Bounds checking can be disabled by [`@inbounds`](@ref), but you need to take care of the shape of `C`, `A`, `B` yourself.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
last(coll)
```

Get the last element of an ordered collection, if it can be computed in O(1) time. This is accomplished by calling [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last index. Return the end point of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) even if it is empty.

See also [`first`](@ref), [`endswith`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(1:2:10)
9

julia> last([1; 2; 3; 4])
4
```

```
last(itr, n::Integer)
```

Get the last `n` elements of the iterable collection `itr`, or fewer elements if `itr` is not long enough.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last(["foo", "bar", "qux"], 2)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "bar"
 "qux"

julia> last(1:6, 10)
1:6

julia> last(Float64[], 1)
Float64[]
```

```
last(s::AbstractString, n::Integer)
```

Get a string consisting of the last `n` characters of `s`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 0)
""

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 1)
"0"

julia> last("∀ϵ≠0: ϵ²>0", 3)
"²>0"
```
```
lastindex(collection) -> Integer
lastindex(collection, d) -> Integer
```

Return the last index of `collection`. If `d` is given, return the last index of `collection` along dimension `d`.

The syntaxes `A[end]` and `A[end, end]` lower to `A[lastindex(A)]` and `A[lastindex(A, 1), lastindex(A, 2)]`, respectively.

See also: [`axes`](@ref), [`firstindex`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lastindex([1,2,4])
3

julia> lastindex(rand(3,4,5), 2)
4
```
```
lcm(x, y...)
```

Least common (positive) multiple (or zero if any argument is zero). The arguments may be integer and rational numbers.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    Rational arguments require Julia 1.4 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lcm(2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(-2, 3)
6

julia> lcm(0, 3)
0

julia> lcm(0, 0)
0

julia> lcm(1//3, 2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, -2//3)
2//3

julia> lcm(1//3, 2)
2//1

julia> lcm(1, 3, 5, 7)
105
```
```
ldexp(x, n)
```

Compute $x \times 2^n$.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ldexp(5., 2)
20.0
```
```
leading_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_ones(UInt32(2 ^ 32 - 2))
31
```
```
leading_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros leading the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> leading_zeros(Int32(1))
31
```
```
length(collection) -> Integer
```

Return the number of elements in the collection.

Use [`lastindex`](@ref) to get the last valid index of an indexable collection.

See also: [`size`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length(1:5)
5

julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the number of elements in the array, defaults to `prod(size(A))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length([1, 2, 3, 4])
4

julia> length([1 2; 3 4])
4
```

```
length(s::AbstractString) -> Int
length(s::AbstractString, i::Integer, j::Integer) -> Int
```

Return the number of characters in string `s` from indices `i` through `j`.

This is computed as the number of code unit indices from `i` to `j` which are valid character indices. With only a single string argument, this computes the number of characters in the entire string. With `i` and `j` arguments it computes the number of indices between `i` and `j` inclusive that are valid indices in the string `s`. In addition to in-bounds values, `i` may take the out-of-bounds value `ncodeunits(s) + 1` and `j` may take the out-of-bounds value `0`.

!!! note
    The time complexity of this operation is linear in general. That is, it will take the time proportional to the number of bytes or characters in the string because it counts the value on the fly. This is in contrast to the method for arrays, which is a constant-time operation.


See also [`isvalid`](@ref), [`ncodeunits`](@ref), [`lastindex`](@ref), [`thisind`](@ref), [`nextind`](@ref), [`prevind`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> length("jμΛIα")
5
```
```
lock(lock)
```

Acquire the `lock` when it becomes available. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

Each `lock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).

```
lock(f::Function, lock)
```

Acquire the `lock`, execute `f` with the `lock` held, and release the `lock` when `f` returns. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, wait for it to become available.

When this function returns, the `lock` has been released, so the caller should not attempt to `unlock` it.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Using a [`Channel`](@ref) as the second argument requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
log(b,x)
```

Compute the base `b` logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(4,8)
1.5

julia> log(4,2)
0.5

julia> log(-2, 3)

```

!!! note
    If `b` is a power of 2 or 10, [`log2`](@ref) or [`log10`](@ref) should be used, as these will typically be faster and more accurate. For example,

    ```jldoctest
    julia> log(100,1000000)
    2.9999999999999996

    julia> log10(1000000)/2
    3.0
    ```


```
log(x)
```

Compute the natural logarithm of `x`. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments to obtain complex results.

See also [`log1p`], [`log2`], [`log10`].

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> log(2)

```
log(A::StridedMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalue, compute the principal matrix logarithm of `A`, i.e. the unique matrix $X$ such that $e^X = A$ and $-\pi < Im(\lambda) < \pi$ for all the eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $X$. If `A` has nonpositive eigenvalues, a nonprincipal matrix function is returned whenever possible.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used, if `A` is triangular an improved version of the inverse scaling and squaring method is employed (see [^AH12] and [^AHR13]). If `A` is real with no negative eigenvalues, then the real Schur form is computed. Otherwise, the complex Schur form is computed. Then the upper (quasi-)triangular algorithm in [^AHR13] is used on the upper (quasi-)triangular factor.

```
lowercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to lowercase.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`lowercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercase("STRINGS AND THINGS")
"strings and things"
```
```
lowercasefirst(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to lowercase.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lowercasefirst("Julia")
"julia"
```
```
lpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the left with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> lpad("March", 10)
"     March"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
lstat(file)
```

Like [`stat`](@ref), but for symbolic links gets the info for the link itself rather than the file it refers to. This function must be called on a file path rather than a file object or a file descriptor.
```
lstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
lstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = lpad("March", 20)
"               March"

julia> lstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
ltoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Little-endian to that used by the Host.
```
macroexpand(m::Module, x; recursive=true)
```

Take the expression `x` and return an equivalent expression with all macros removed (expanded) for executing in module `m`. The `recursive` keyword controls whether deeper levels of nested macros are also expanded. This is demonstrated in the example below:

```julia-repl

map(f, c...) -> collection
```

Transform collection `c` by applying `f` to each element. For multiple collection arguments, apply `f` elementwise, and stop when when any of them is exhausted.

See also [`map!`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`mapreduce`](@ref), [`mapslices`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`Iterators.map`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> map(x -> x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 4
 6

julia> map(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 400, 5000])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 11
 22
 33
```

```
map(f, A::AbstractArray...) -> N-array
```

When acting on multi-dimensional arrays of the same [`ndims`](@ref), they must all have the same [`axes`](@ref), and the answer will too.

See also [`broadcast`](@ref), which allows mismatched sizes.

# Examples

```
julia> map(//, [1 2; 3 4], [4 3; 2 1])
2×2 Matrix{Rational{Int64}}:
 1//4  2//3
 3//2  4//1

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], zeros(2,1))
ERROR: DimensionMismatch

julia> map(+, [1 2; 3 4], [1,10,100,1000], zeros(3,1))  # iterates until 3rd is exhausted
3-element Vector{Float64}:
   2.0
  13.0
 102.0
```
```
map!(function, destination, collection...)
```

Like [`map`](@ref), but stores the result in `destination` rather than a new collection. `destination` must be at least as large as the smallest collection.

See also: [`map`](@ref), [`foreach`](@ref), [`zip`](@ref), [`copyto!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = zeros(3);

julia> map!(x -> x * 2, a, [1, 2, 3]);

julia> a
3-element Vector{Float64}:
 2.0

 105
   0
   0
```

```
map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))
```

Modifies `dict` by transforming each value from `val` to `f(val)`. Note that the type of `dict` cannot be changed: if `f(val)` is not an instance of the value type of `dict` then it will be converted to the value type if possible and otherwise raise an error.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `map!(f, values(dict::AbstractDict))` requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2)
Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries:
  :a => 1
  :b => 2

julia> map!(v -> v-1, values(d))
ValueIterator for a Dict{Symbol, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  0
  1
```
```
mapfoldl(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed left associativity, as in [`foldl`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapfoldr(f, op, itr; [init])
```

Like [`mapreduce`](@ref), but with guaranteed right associativity, as in [`foldr`](@ref). If provided, the keyword argument `init` will be used exactly once. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.
```
mapreduce(f, op, itrs...; [init])
```

Apply function `f` to each element(s) in `itrs`, and then reduce the result using the binary function `op`. If provided, `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections. In general, it will be necessary to provide `init` to work with empty collections.

[`mapreduce`](@ref) is functionally equivalent to calling `reduce(op, map(f, itr); init=init)`, but will in general execute faster since no intermediate collection needs to be created. See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref) and [`map`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mapreduce(x->x^2, +, [1:3;]) # == 1 + 4 + 9
14
```

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent. Additionally, some implementations may reuse the return value of `f` for elements that appear multiple times in `itr`. Use [`mapfoldl`](@ref) or [`mapfoldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity and invocation of `f` for every value.

```
mapreduce(f, op, A::AbstractArray...; dims=:, [init])
```

Evaluates to the same as `reduce(op, map(f, A...); dims=dims, init=init)`, but is generally faster because the intermediate array is avoided.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    `mapreduce` with multiple iterators requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))

julia> mapreduce(isodd, |, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  1  1  1
```
```
mapslices(f, A; dims)
```

Transform the given dimensions of array `A` using function `f`. `f` is called on each slice of `A` of the form `A[...,:,...,:,...]`. `dims` is an integer vector specifying where the colons go in this expression. The results are concatenated along the remaining dimensions. For example, if `dims` is `[1,2]` and `A` is 4-dimensional, `f` is called on `A[:,:,i,j]` for all `i` and `j`.

See also [`eachcol`](@ref), [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16),(2,2,2,2))

```
```
mark(s::IO)
```

Add a mark at the current position of stream `s`. Return the marked position.

See also [`unmark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
match(r::Regex, s::AbstractString[, idx::Integer[, addopts]])
```

Search for the first match of the regular expression `r` in `s` and return a [`RegexMatch`](@ref) object containing the match, or nothing if the match failed. The matching substring can be retrieved by accessing `m.match` and the captured sequences can be retrieved by accessing `m.captures` The optional `idx` argument specifies an index at which to start the search.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rx = r"a(.)a"
r"a(.)a"

julia> m = match(rx, "cabac")
RegexMatch("aba", 1="b")

julia> m.captures
1-element Vector{Union{Nothing, SubString{String}}}:
 "b"

julia> m.match
"aba"

julia> match(rx, "cabac", 3) === nothing
true
```
```
max(x, y, ...)
```

Return the maximum of the arguments (with respect to [`isless`](@ref)). See also the [`maximum`](@ref) function to take the maximum element from a collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> max(2, 5, 1)
5
```
```
maximum(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest result of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> maximum(length, ["Julion", "Julia", "Jule"])

julia> maximum(length, []; init=-1)
-1

julia> maximum(sin, Real[]; init=-1.0)  # good, since output of sin is >= -1
-1.0
```

```
maximum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the largest element in a collection.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be a neutral element for `max` (i.e. which is less than or equal to any other element) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

```

```
maximum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`max(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the maximum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `max.(a,b)`.

See also: [`maximum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmax`](@ref), [`argmax`](@ref).

julia> maximum(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 2
 4
```

```
maximum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the maximum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2

```
maximum!(r, A)
```

Compute the maximum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

```
```
maxintfloat(T=Float64)
```

The largest consecutive integer-valued floating-point number that is exactly represented in the given floating-point type `T` (which defaults to `Float64`).

That is, `maxintfloat` returns the smallest positive integer-valued floating-point number `n` such that `n+1` is *not* exactly representable in the type `T`.

When an `Integer`-type value is needed, use `Integer(maxintfloat(T))`.

```
maxintfloat(T, S)
```

The largest consecutive integer representable in the given floating-point type `T` that also does not exceed the maximum integer representable by the integer type `S`.  Equivalently, it is the minimum of `maxintfloat(T)` and [`typemax(S)`](@ref).
```
merge(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. If the same key is present in another collection, the value for that key will be the value it has in the last collection listed. See also [`mergewith`](@ref) for custom handling of values with the same key.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict("foo" => 0.0, "bar" => 42.0)
Dict{String, Float64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> b = Dict("baz" => 17, "bar" => 4711)
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "bar" => 4711
  "baz" => 17

julia> merge(a, b)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 4711.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0

julia> merge(b, a)
Dict{String, Float64} with 3 entries:
  "bar" => 42.0
  "baz" => 17.0
  "foo" => 0.0
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, bs::NamedTuple...)
```

Construct a new named tuple by merging two or more existing ones, in a left-associative manner. Merging proceeds left-to-right, between pairs of named tuples, and so the order of fields present in both the leftmost and rightmost named tuples take the same position as they are found in the leftmost named tuple. However, values are taken from matching fields in the rightmost named tuple that contains that field. Fields present in only the rightmost named tuple of a pair are appended at the end. A fallback is implemented for when only a single named tuple is supplied, with signature `merge(a::NamedTuple)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Merging 3 or more `NamedTuple` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), (b=4, d=5))
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2), (b=3, c=(d=1,)), (c=(d=2,),))
(a = 1, b = 3, c = (d = 2,))
```

```
merge(a::NamedTuple, iterable)
```

Interpret an iterable of key-value pairs as a named tuple, and perform a merge.

```jldoctest
julia> merge((a=1, b=2, c=3), [:b=>4, :d=>5])
(a = 1, b = 4, c = 3, d = 5)
```
```
merge!(d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. See also [`merge`](@ref).

# Examples

julia> d1 = Dict(1 => 2, 3 => 4);

julia> d2 = Dict(1 => 4, 4 => 5);

julia> merge!(d1, d2);

julia> d1
Dict{Int64, Int64} with 3 entries:
  4 => 5
  3 => 4
  1 => 4
```
```
mergewith(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
mergewith(combine)
merge(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...)
```

Construct a merged collection from the given collections. If necessary, the types of the resulting collection will be promoted to accommodate the types of the merged collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
mergewith!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
mergewith!(combine)
merge!(combine, d::AbstractDict, others::AbstractDict...) -> d
```

Update collection with pairs from the other collections. Values with the same key will be combined using the combiner function.  The curried form `mergewith!(combine)` returns the function `(args...) -> mergewith!(combine, args...)`.

Method `merge!(combine::Union{Function,Type}, args...)` as an alias of `mergewith!(combine, args...)` is still available for backward compatibility.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"

```
```
methods(f, [types], [module])
```

Return the method table for `f`.

```
minimum(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value of an array over the given dimensions. See also the [`min(a,b)`](@ref) function to take the minimum of two or more arguments, which can be applied elementwise to arrays via `min.(a,b)`.

See also: [`minimum!`](@ref), [`extrema`](@ref), [`findmin`](@ref), [`argmin`](@ref).

```

```
minimum(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Compute the minimum value by calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```
minimum!(r, A)
```

Compute the minimum value of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

minmax(x, y)
```

Return `(min(x,y), max(x,y))`.

```
mkdir(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Make a new directory with name `path` and permissions `mode`. `mode` defaults to `0o777`, modified by the current file creation mask. This function never creates more than one directory. If the directory already exists, or some intermediate directories do not exist, this function throws an error. See [`mkpath`](@ref) for a function which creates all required intermediate directories. Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> mkdir("testingdir")
"testingdir"

julia> cd("testingdir")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/testingdir"
```
```
mkpath(path::AbstractString; mode::Unsigned = 0o777)
```

Create all intermediate directories in the `path` as required. Directories are created with the permissions `mode` which defaults to `0o777` and is modified by the current file creation mask. Unlike [`mkdir`](@ref), `mkpath` does not error if `path` (or parts of it) already exists. However, an error will be thrown if `path` (or parts of it) points to an existing file. Return `path`.

If `path` includes a filename you will probably want to use `mkpath(dirname(path))` to avoid creating a directory using the filename.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> cd(mktempdir())

julia> mkpath("my/test/dir") # creates three directories
"my/test/dir"

julia> readdir()
1-element Array{String,1}:
 "my"

```
```
mktemp(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> (path, io)
```

Return `(path, io)`, where `path` is the path of a new temporary file in `parent` and `io` is an open file object for this path. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary file is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktemp` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


```
mktemp(f::Function, parent=tempdir())
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktemp(parent)`](@ref) and remove the temporary file upon completion.

See also: [`mktempdir`](@ref).
```
mktempdir(parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_", cleanup=true) -> path
```

Create a temporary directory in the `parent` directory with a name constructed from the given prefix and a random suffix, and return its path. Additionally, any trailing `X` characters may be replaced with random characters. If `parent` does not exist, throw an error. The `cleanup` option controls whether the temporary directory is automatically deleted when the process exits.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.


!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    The `cleanup` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.3. Relatedly, starting from 1.3, Julia will remove the temporary paths created by `mktempdir` when the Julia process exits, unless `cleanup` is explicitly set to `false`.


See also: [`mktemp`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref).

```
mktempdir(f::Function, parent=tempdir(); prefix="jl_")
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of [`mktempdir(parent; prefix)`](@ref) and remove the temporary directory all of its contents upon completion.

See also: [`mktemp`](@ref), [`mkdir`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The `prefix` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.2.

```
mod(x::Integer, r::AbstractUnitRange)
```

Find `y` in the range `r` such that $x ≡ y (mod n)$, where `n = length(r)`, i.e. `y = mod(x - first(r), n) + first(r)`.

See also [`mod1`](@ref).

```
mod(x, y)
rem(x, y, RoundDown)
```

The reduction of `x` modulo `y`, or equivalently, the remainder of `x` after floored division by `y`, i.e. `x - y*fld(x,y)` if computed without intermediate rounding.

The result will have the same sign as `y`, and magnitude less than `abs(y)` (with some exceptions, see note below).

!!! note
    When used with floating point values, the exact result may not be representable by the type, and so rounding error may occur. In particular, if the exact result is very close to `y`, then it may be rounded to `y`.

rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```
```
mod1(x, y)
```

Modulus after flooring division, returning a value `r` such that `mod(r, y) == mod(x, y)` in the range $(0, y]$ for positive `y` and in the range $[y,0)$ for negative `y`.

With integer arguments and positive `y`, this is equal to `mod(x, 1:y)`, and hence natural for 1-based indexing. By comparison, `mod(x, y) == mod(x, 0:y-1)` is natural for computations with offsets or strides.

See also [`mod`](@ref), [`fld1`](@ref), [`fldmod1`](@ref).

```
```
mod2pi(x)
```

Modulus after division by `2π`, returning in the range $[0,2π)$.

This function computes a floating point representation of the modulus after division by numerically exact `2π`, and is therefore not exactly the same as `mod(x,2π)`, which would compute the modulus of `x` relative to division by the floating-point number `2π`.

!!! note
    Depending on the format of the input value, the closest representable value to 2π may be less than 2π. For example, the expression `mod2pi(2π)` will not return `0`, because the intermediate value of `2*π` is a `Float64` and `2*Float64(π) < 2*big(π)`. See [`rem2pi`](@ref) for more refined control of this behavior.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mod2pi(9*pi/4)
0.7853981633974481
```
```
modf(x)
```

Return a tuple `(fpart, ipart)` of the fractional and integral parts of a number. Both parts have the same sign as the argument.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> modf(3.5)
(0.5, 3.0)

julia> modf(-3.5)
(-0.5, -3.0)
```
```
modifyproperty!(x, f::Symbol, op, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic! max(a().b, c)` returns `modifyproperty!(a(), :b, max, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where the first argument must be a `getfield` expression and is modified atomically.

See also [`modifyfield!`](@ref Core.modifyfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
mtime(file)
```

Equivalent to `stat(file).mtime`.
```
muladd(x, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add: computes `x*y+z`, but allowing the add and multiply to be merged with each other or with surrounding operations for performance. For example, this may be implemented as an [`fma`](@ref) if the hardware supports it efficiently. The result can be different on different machines and can also be different on the same machine due to constant propagation or other optimizations. See [`fma`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> muladd(3, 2, 1)
7

julia> 3 * 2 + 1
7
```

```
muladd(A, y, z)
```

Combined multiply-add, `A*y .+ z`, for matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. The result is always the same size as `A*y`, but `z` may be smaller, or a scalar.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    These methods require Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest

```
mv(src::AbstractString, dst::AbstractString; force::Bool=false)
```

Move the file, link, or directory from `src` to `dst`. `force=true` will first remove an existing `dst`. Return `dst`.

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"

julia> mv("hello.txt", "goodbye.txt")
"goodbye.txt"

julia> "hello.txt" in readdir()

nameof(m::Module) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a `Module` as a [`Symbol`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nameof(Base.Broadcast)
:Broadcast
```

```
nameof(t::DataType) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType` (without its parent module) as a symbol.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct S{T}
           end
       end
Foo

julia> nameof(Foo.S{T} where T)
:S
```

```
nameof(f::Function) -> Symbol
```

Get the name of a generic `Function` as a symbol. For anonymous functions, this is a compiler-generated name. For explicitly-declared subtypes of `Function`, it is the name of the function's type.
```
names(x::Module; all::Bool = false, imported::Bool = false)
```

Get an array of the names exported by a `Module`, excluding deprecated names. If `all` is true, then the list also includes non-exported names defined in the module, deprecated names, and compiler-generated names. If `imported` is true, then names explicitly imported from other modules are also included.

As a special case, all names defined in `Main` are considered "exported", since it is not idiomatic to explicitly export names from `Main`.

```
nand(x, y)
⊼(x, y)
```

Bitwise nand (not and) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊼ b` is a synonym for `nand(a,b)`, and `⊼` can be typed by tab-completing `\nand` or `\barwedge` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

ncodeunits(c::Char) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units required to encode a character as UTF-8. This is the number of bytes which will be printed if the character is written to an output stream, or `ncodeunits(string(c))` but computed efficiently.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.1. In Julia 1.0 consider using `ncodeunits(string(c))`.


```
ncodeunits(s::AbstractString) -> Int
```

Return the number of code units in a string. Indices that are in bounds to access this string must satisfy `1 ≤ i ≤ ncodeunits(s)`. Not all such indices are valid – they may not be the start of a character, but they will return a code unit value when calling `codeunit(s,i)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ncodeunits("The Julia Language")
18

julia> ncodeunits("∫eˣ")
6

julia> ncodeunits('∫'), ncodeunits('e'), ncodeunits('ˣ')
(3, 1, 2)
```

```
ndigits(n::Integer; base::Integer=10, pad::Integer=1)
```

Compute the number of digits in integer `n` written in base `base` (`base` must not be in `[-1, 0, 1]`), optionally padded with zeros to a specified size (the result will never be less than `pad`).

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`count_ones`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ndigits(12345)
5

julia> ndigits(1022, base=16)

```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat, n::Integer)
```

The result of `n` iterative applications of `nextfloat` to `x` if `n >= 0`, or `-n` applications of [`prevfloat`](@ref) if `n < 0`.

```
nextfloat(x::AbstractFloat)
```

Return the smallest floating point number `y` of the same type as `x` such `x < y`. If no such `y` exists (e.g. if `x` is `Inf` or `NaN`), then return `x`.

See also: [`prevfloat`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref), [`issubnormal`](@ref).
```
nextind(str::AbstractString, i::Integer, n::Integer=1) -> Int
```

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts after index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the next character; if `i` is not the start of a character, move forward until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `0` return `1`. If `i` is in bounds but greater or equal to `lastindex(str)` return `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `nextind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `nextind` would reach `ncodeunits(str)+1` then each remaining iteration increases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `nextind` can return a value greater than `ncodeunits(str)+1`.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `s` or is equal to `0`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nextind("α", 0)
1

julia> nextind("α", 1)
3

julia> nextind("α", 3)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [3]

```
```
nextpow(a, x)
```

The smallest `a^n` not less than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must be greater than 0.

```
nextprod(factors::Union{Tuple,AbstractVector}, n)
```

Next integer greater than or equal to `n` that can be written as $\prod k_i^{p_i}$ for integers $p_1$, $p_2$, etcetera, for factors $k_i$ in `factors`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

```
nor(x, y)
⊽(x, y)
```

Bitwise nor (not or) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊽ b` is a synonym for `nor(a,b)`, and `⊽` can be typed by tab-completing `\nor` or `\barvee` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest

normpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Normalize a path, removing "." and ".." entries and changing "/" to the canonical path separator for the system.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> normpath("/home/myuser/../example.jl")
"/home/example.jl"

julia> normpath("Documents/Julia") == joinpath("Documents", "Julia")
true
```

```
normpath(path::AbstractString, paths::AbstractString...) -> String
```

Convert a set of paths to a normalized path by joining them together and removing "." and ".." entries. Equivalent to `normpath(joinpath(path, paths...))`.
```
notify(condition, val=nothing; all=true, error=false)
```

Wake up tasks waiting for a condition, passing them `val`. If `all` is `true` (the default), all waiting tasks are woken, otherwise only one is. If `error` is `true`, the passed value is raised as an exception in the woken tasks.

Return the count of tasks woken up. Return 0 if no tasks are waiting on `condition`.
```
ntoh(x)
```

Convert the endianness of a value from Network byte order (big-endian) to that used by the Host.
```
ntuple(f::Function, n::Integer)
```

Create a tuple of length `n`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, 4)
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```

```
ntuple(f, ::Val{N})
```

Create a tuple of length `N`, computing each element as `f(i)`, where `i` is the index of the element. By taking a `Val(N)` argument, it is possible that this version of ntuple may generate more efficient code than the version taking the length as an integer. But `ntuple(f, N)` is preferable to `ntuple(f, Val(N))` in cases where `N` cannot be determined at compile time.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ntuple(i -> 2*i, Val(4))
(2, 4, 6, 8)
```
```
numerator(x)
```

Numerator of the rational representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> numerator(2//3)
2

julia> numerator(4)
4
```
```
objectid(x) -> UInt
```

Get a hash value for `x` based on object identity. `objectid(x)==objectid(y)` if `x === y`.

See also [`hash`](@ref), [`IdDict`](@ref).
```
occursin(needle::Union{AbstractString,AbstractPattern,AbstractChar}, haystack::AbstractString)
```

Determine whether the first argument is a substring of the second. If `needle` is a regular expression, checks whether `haystack` contains a match.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> occursin("Julia", "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin('a', "JuliaLang is pretty cool!")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "aba")
true

julia> occursin(r"a.a", "abba")
false
```

See also [`contains`](@ref).

```
occursin(haystack)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument occurs in `haystack`, i.e. a function equivalent to `needle -> occursin(needle, haystack)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(occursin)}`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires Julia 1.6 or later.

```
oftype(x, y)
```

Convert `y` to the type of `x` (`convert(typeof(x), y)`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 4;

julia> y = 3.;

julia> oftype(x, y)
3

julia> oftype(y, x)
4.0
```
```
one(x)
one(T::type)
```

Return a multiplicative identity for `x`: a value such that `one(x)*x == x*one(x) == x`.  Alternatively `one(T)` can take a type `T`, in which case `one` returns a multiplicative identity for any `x` of type `T`.

If possible, `one(x)` returns a value of the same type as `x`, and `one(T)` returns a value of type `T`.  However, this may not be the case for types representing dimensionful quantities (e.g. time in days), since the multiplicative identity must be dimensionless.  In that case, `one(x)` should return an identity value of the same precision (and shape, for matrices) as `x`.

If you want a quantity that is of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`, even if `x` is dimensionful, use [`oneunit`](@ref) instead.

See also the [`identity`](@ref) function, and `I` in [`LinearAlgebra`](@ref man-linalg) for the identity matrix.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> one(3.7)

```
```
ones([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
ones([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all ones with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> ones(1,2)
1×2 Matrix{Float64}:

 1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im  1.0+0.0im
```
```
oneunit(x::T)
oneunit(T::Type)
```

Returns `T(one(x))`, where `T` is either the type of the argument or (if a type is passed) the argument.  This differs from [`one`](@ref) for dimensionful quantities: `one` is dimensionless (a multiplicative identity) while `oneunit` is dimensionful (of the same type as `x`, or of type `T`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> oneunit(3.7)
1.0

julia> import Dates; oneunit(Dates.Day)
1 day
```
```
only(x)
```

Return the one and only element of collection `x`, or throw an [`ArgumentError`](@ref) if the collection has zero or multiple elements.

open(f::Function, args...; kwargs...)
```

Apply the function `f` to the result of `open(args...; kwargs...)` and close the resulting file descriptor upon completion.

open(filename::AbstractString; lock = true, keywords...) -> IOStream
```

Open a file in a mode specified by five boolean keyword arguments:

| Keyword    | Description            | Default                               |
|:---------- |:---------------------- |:------------------------------------- |
| `read`     | open for reading       | `!write`                              |
| `write`    | open for writing       | `truncate \| append`                  |
| `create`   | create if non-existent | `!read & write \| truncate \| append` |
| `truncate` | truncate to zero size  | `!read & write`                       |
| `append`   | seek to end            | `false`                               |

The default when no keywords are passed is to open files for reading only. Returns a stream for accessing the opened file.

The `lock` keyword argument controls whether operations will be locked for safe multi-threaded access.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The `lock` argument is available as of Julia 1.5.


```
open(filename::AbstractString, [mode::AbstractString]; lock = true) -> IOStream
```

Alternate syntax for open, where a string-based mode specifier is used instead of the five booleans. The values of `mode` correspond to those from `fopen(3)` or Perl `open`, and are equivalent to setting the following boolean groups:

| Mode | Description                   | Keywords                       |
|:---- |:----------------------------- |:------------------------------ |

```
open(fd::OS_HANDLE) -> IO
```

Take a raw file descriptor wrap it in a Julia-aware IO type, and take ownership of the fd handle. Call `open(Libc.dup(fd))` to avoid the ownership capture of the original handle.

!!! warning
    Do not call this on a handle that's already owned by some other part of the system.


```
open(command, mode::AbstractString, stdio=devnull)
```

Run `command` asynchronously. Like `open(command, stdio; read, write)` except specifying the read and write flags via a mode string instead of keyword arguments. Possible mode strings are:

| `w+` | read, write | `read = true, write = true` |

```
open(command, stdio=devnull; write::Bool = false, read::Bool = !write)
```

Start running `command` asynchronously, and return a `process::IO` object.  If `read` is true, then reads from the process come from the process's standard output and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard input stream.  If `write` is true, then writes go to the process's standard input and `stdio` optionally specifies the process's standard output stream. The process's standard error stream is connected to the current global `stderr`.

```
open(f::Function, command, args...; kwargs...)
```

Similar to `open(command, args...; kwargs...)`, but calls `f(stream)` on the resulting process stream, then closes the input stream and waits for the process to complete. Return the value returned by `f` on success. Throw an error if the process failed, or if the process attempts to print anything to stdout.
```
operm(file)
```

Like [`uperm`](@ref) but gets the permissions for people who neither own the file nor are a member of the group owning the file
```
pairs(collection)
```

Return an iterator over `key => value` pairs for any collection that maps a set of keys to a set of values. This includes arrays, where the keys are the array indices.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Dict(zip(["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]))
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> pairs(a)
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "c" => 3
  "b" => 2
  "a" => 1

julia> foreach(println, pairs(["a", "b", "c"]))
1 => "a"
2 => "b"
3 => "c"

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> pairs |> collect
3-element Vector{Pair{Symbol, Int64}}:
 :a => 1
 :b => 2
 :c => 3

julia> (;a=1, b=2, c=3) |> collect
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```

```
pairs(IndexLinear(), A)
pairs(IndexCartesian(), A)
pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
```

An iterator that accesses each element of the array `A`, returning `i => x`, where `i` is the index for the element and `x = A[i]`. Identical to `pairs(A)`, except that the style of index can be selected. Also similar to `enumerate(A)`, except `i` will be a valid index for `A`, while `enumerate` always counts from 1 regardless of the indices of `A`.

Specifying [`IndexLinear()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be an integer; specifying [`IndexCartesian()`](@ref) ensures that `i` will be a [`CartesianIndex`](@ref); specifying `IndexStyle(A)` chooses whichever has been defined as the native indexing style for array `A`.

Mutation of the bounds of the underlying array will invalidate this iterator.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = ["a" "d"; "b" "e"; "c" "f"];

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(A), A)
           println("$index $value")
       end
1 a
2 b
3 c
4 d
5 e
6 f

julia> S = view(A, 1:2, :);

julia> for (index, value) in pairs(IndexStyle(S), S)
           println("$index $value")
       end
CartesianIndex(1, 1) a
CartesianIndex(2, 1) b
CartesianIndex(1, 2) d
CartesianIndex(2, 2) e
```

See also [`IndexStyle`](@ref), [`axes`](@ref).
```
parent(A)
```

Return the underlying "parent array”. This parent array of objects of types `SubArray`, `ReshapedArray` or `LinearAlgebra.Transpose` is what was passed as an argument to `view`, `reshape`, `transpose`, etc. during object creation. If the input is not a wrapped object, return the input itself. If the input is wrapped multiple times, only the outermost wrapper will be removed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> V = view(A, 1:2, :)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1:2, :) with eltype Int64:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> parent(V)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
parentindices(A)
```

Return the indices in the [`parent`](@ref) which correspond to the array view `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> V = view(A, 1, :)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, 1, :) with eltype Int64:
 1
 2

julia> parentindices(V)
(1, Base.Slice(Base.OneTo(2)))
```
```
parentmodule(m::Module) -> Module
```

Get a module's enclosing `Module`. `Main` is its own parent.

See also: [`names`](@ref), [`nameof`](@ref), [`fullname`](@ref), [`@__MODULE__`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parentmodule(Main)
Main

julia> parentmodule(Base.Broadcast)
Base
```

```
parentmodule(t::DataType) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the definition of a (potentially `UnionAll`-wrapped) `DataType`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> module Foo
           struct Int end
       end
Foo

julia> parentmodule(Int)
Core

julia> parentmodule(Foo.Int)
Foo
```

```
parentmodule(f::Function) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing the (first) definition of a generic function.

```
parentmodule(f::Function, types) -> Module
```

Determine the module containing a given definition of a generic function.
```
parse(type, str; base)
```

Parse a string as a number. For `Integer` types, a base can be specified (the default is 10). For floating-point types, the string is parsed as a decimal floating-point number.  `Complex` types are parsed from decimal strings of the form `"R±Iim"` as a `Complex(R,I)` of the requested type; `"i"` or `"j"` can also be used instead of `"im"`, and `"R"` or `"Iim"` are also permitted. If the string does not contain a valid number, an error is raised.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `parse(Bool, str)` requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> parse(Int, "1234")
1234

julia> parse(Int, "1234", base = 5)
194

julia> parse(Int, "afc", base = 16)
2812

julia> parse(Float64, "1.2e-3")
0.0012

julia> parse(Complex{Float64}, "3.2e-1 + 4.5im")
0.32 + 4.5im
```

```
parse(::Type{Platform}, triplet::AbstractString)
```

Parses a string platform triplet back into a `Platform` object.
```
partialsort(v, k, by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Variant of [`partialsort!`](@ref) which copies `v` before partially sorting it, thereby returning the same thing as `partialsort!` but leaving `v` unmodified.
```
partialsort!(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Partially sort the vector `v` in place, according to the order specified by `by`, `lt` and `rev` so that the value at index `k` (or range of adjacent values if `k` is a range) occurs at the position where it would appear if the array were fully sorted via a non-stable algorithm. If `k` is a single index, that value is returned; if `k` is a range, an array of values at those indices is returned. Note that `partialsort!` does not fully sort the input array.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4)
4

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

julia> a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 4]
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 4
 3
 4

julia> partialsort!(a, 4, rev=true)
2

julia> a
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
partialsortperm(v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return a partial permutation `I` of the vector `v`, so that `v[I]` returns values of a fully sorted version of `v` at index `k`. If `k` is a range, a vector of indices is returned; if `k` is an integer, a single index is returned. The order is specified using the same keywords as `sort!`. The permutation is stable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

Note that this function is equivalent to, but more efficient than, calling `sortperm(...)[k]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> v[partialsortperm(v, 1)]
1

julia> p = partialsortperm(v, 1:3)
3-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 1:3) with eltype Int64:
 2
 4
 3

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
```
```
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false, initialized=false)
```

Like [`partialsortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix` the same size as `v`, which is used to store (a permutation of) the indices of `v`.

If the index vector `ix` is initialized with the indices of `v` (or a permutation thereof), `initialized` should be set to `true`.

If `initialized` is `false` (the default), then `ix` is initialized to contain the indices of `v`.

If `initialized` is `true`, but `ix` does not contain (a permutation of) the indices of `v`, the behavior of `partialsortperm!` is undefined.

(Typically, the indices of `v` will be `1:length(v)`, although if `v` has an alternative array type with non-one-based indices, such as an `OffsetArray`, `ix` must also be an `OffsetArray` with the same indices, and must contain as values (a permutation of) these same indices.)

Upon return, `ix` is guaranteed to have the indices `k` in their sorted positions, such that

```julia
partialsortperm!(ix, v, k);
v[ix[k]] == partialsort(v, k)
```

The return value is the `k`th element of `ix` if `k` is an integer, or view into `ix` if `k` is a range.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2, 1];

julia> ix = Vector{Int}(undef, 4);

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 1)
2

julia> ix = [1:4;];

julia> partialsortperm!(ix, v, 2:3, initialized=true)
2-element view(::Vector{Int64}, 2:3) with eltype Int64:
 4
 3
```

```

```
```
pathof(m::Module)
```

Return the path of the `m.jl` file that was used to `import` module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package.

Use [`dirname`](@ref) to get the directory part and [`basename`](@ref) to get the file name part of the path.
```
peek(stream[, T=UInt8])
```

Read and return a value of type `T` from a stream without advancing the current position in the stream.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = IOBuffer("julia");

julia> peek(b)
0x6a

julia> position(b)
0

julia> peek(b, Char)
'j': ASCII/Unicode U+006A (category Ll: Letter, lowercase)
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The method which accepts a type requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
permute!(v, p)
```

Permute vector `v` in-place, according to permutation `p`. No checking is done to verify that `p` is a permutation.

To return a new permutation, use `v[p]`. Note that this is generally faster than `permute!(v,p)` for large vectors.

See also [`invpermute!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1, 1, 3, 4];

julia> perm = [2, 4, 3, 1];

julia> permute!(A, perm);

julia> A
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 3
 1
```

```
permute!(X::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         p::AbstractVector{<:Integer}, q::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         [C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

Bilaterally permute `A`, storing result `PAQ` (`A[p,q]`) in `X`. Stores intermediate result `(AQ)^T` (`transpose(A[:,q])`) in optional argument `C` if present. Requires that none of `X`, `A`, and, if present, `C` alias each other; to store result `PAQ` back into `A`, use the following method lacking `X`:

```
permute!(A::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}, p::AbstractVector{<:Integer},
         q::AbstractVector{<:Integer}[, C::AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti},
         [workcolptr::Vector{Ti}]]) where {Tv,Ti}
```

`X`'s dimensions must match those of `A` (`size(X, 1) == size(A, 1)` and `size(X, 2) == size(A, 2)`), and `X` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(X)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(X)) >= nnz(A)`). Column-permutation `q`'s length must match `A`'s column count (`length(q) == size(A, 2)`). Row-permutation `p`'s length must match `A`'s row count (`length(p) == size(A, 1)`).

`C`'s dimensions must match those of `transpose(A)` (`size(C, 1) == size(A, 2)` and `size(C, 2) == size(A, 1)`), and `C` must have enough storage to accommodate all allocated entries in `A` (`length(rowvals(C)) >= nnz(A)` and `length(nonzeros(C)) >= nnz(A)`).

For additional (algorithmic) information, and for versions of these methods that forgo argument checking, see (unexported) parent methods `unchecked_noalias_permute!` and `unchecked_aliasing_permute!`.

See also [`permute`](@ref).
```
permutedims(A::AbstractArray, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `A`. `perm` is a vector or a tuple of length `ndims(A)` specifying the permutation.

See also [`permutedims!`](@ref), [`PermutedDimsArray`](@ref), [`transpose`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2))
2×2×2 Array{Int64, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  3
 2  4

[:, :, 2] =
 5  7

julia> B = randn(5, 7, 11, 13);

julia> perm = [4,1,3,2];

julia> size(permutedims(B, perm))
(13, 5, 11, 7)

julia> size(B)[perm] == ans
true
```

```
permutedims(m::AbstractMatrix)
```

Permute the dimensions of the matrix `m`, by flipping the elements across the diagonal of the matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> b = [5 6; 7 8];

julia> c = [9 10; 11 12];

julia> d = [13 14; 15 16];

julia> X = [[a] [b]; [c] [d]]
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]     [5 6; 7 8]
 [9 10; 11 12]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> permutedims(X)
2×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [9 10; 11 12]
 [5 6; 7 8]  [13 14; 15 16]

julia> transpose(X)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [9 11; 10 12]
 [5 7; 6 8]  [13 15; 14 16]
```

```
permutedims(v::AbstractVector)
```

Reshape vector `v` into a `1 × length(v)` row matrix. Differs from `LinearAlgebra`'s [`transpose`](@ref) in that the operation is not recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest; setup = :(using LinearAlgebra)
julia> permutedims([1, 2, 3, 4])
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4

julia> V = [[[1 2; 3 4]]; [[5 6; 7 8]]]
2-element Vector{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]
 [5 6; 7 8]

julia> permutedims(V)
1×2 Matrix{Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 2; 3 4]  [5 6; 7 8]

julia> transpose(V)
1×2 transpose(::Vector{Matrix{Int64}}) with eltype Transpose{Int64, Matrix{Int64}}:
 [1 3; 2 4]  [5 7; 6 8]
```
```
permutedims!(dest, src, perm)
```

Permute the dimensions of array `src` and store the result in the array `dest`. `perm` is a vector specifying a permutation of length `ndims(src)`. The preallocated array `dest` should have `size(dest) == size(src)[perm]` and is completely overwritten. No in-place permutation is supported and unexpected results will happen if `src` and `dest` have overlapping memory regions.

See also [`permutedims`](@ref).
```
pipeline(command; stdin, stdout, stderr, append=false)
```

Redirect I/O to or from the given `command`. Keyword arguments specify which of the command's streams should be redirected. `append` controls whether file output appends to the file. This is a more general version of the 2-argument `pipeline` function. `pipeline(from, to)` is equivalent to `pipeline(from, stdout=to)` when `from` is a command, and to `pipeline(to, stdin=from)` when `from` is another kind of data source.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`dothings`, stdout="out.txt", stderr="errs.txt"))
run(pipeline(`update`, stdout="log.txt", append=true))
```

```
pipeline(from, to, ...)
```

Create a pipeline from a data source to a destination. The source and destination can be commands, I/O streams, strings, or results of other `pipeline` calls. At least one argument must be a command. Strings refer to filenames. When called with more than two arguments, they are chained together from left to right. For example, `pipeline(a,b,c)` is equivalent to `pipeline(pipeline(a,b),c)`. This provides a more concise way to specify multi-stage pipelines.

**Examples**:

```julia
run(pipeline(`ls`, `grep xyz`))
run(pipeline(`ls`, "out.txt"))
run(pipeline("out.txt", `grep xyz`))
```
```
pkgdir(m::Module[, paths::String...])
```

Return the root directory of the package that imported module `m`, or `nothing` if `m` was not imported from a package. Optionally further path component strings can be provided to construct a path within the package root.

```julia-repl
julia> pkgdir(Foo)
"/path/to/Foo.jl"

julia> pkgdir(Foo, "src", "file.jl")
"/path/to/Foo.jl/src/file.jl"
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The optional argument `paths` requires at least Julia 1.7.

No documentation found.

Binding `pkgversion` does not exist.
```
pointer(array [, index])
```

Get the native address of an array or string, optionally at a given location `index`.

This function is "unsafe". Be careful to ensure that a Julia reference to `array` exists as long as this pointer will be used. The [`GC.@preserve`](@ref) macro should be used to protect the `array` argument from garbage collection within a given block of code.

Calling [`Ref(array[, index])`](@ref Ref) is generally preferable to this function as it guarantees validity.
```
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

Get the memory address of a Julia object as a `Ptr`. The existence of the resulting `Ptr` will not protect the object from garbage collection, so you must ensure that the object remains referenced for the whole time that the `Ptr` will be used.

This function may not be called on immutable objects, since they do not have stable memory addresses.

See also [`unsafe_pointer_to_objref`](@ref).
```
pop!(collection) -> item
```

Remove an item in `collection` and return it. If `collection` is an ordered container, the last item is returned; for unordered containers, an arbitrary element is returned.

See also: [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), and [`push!`](@ref).

julia> pop!(Dict(1=>2))
1 => 2
```

```
pop!(collection, key[, default])
```

Delete and return the mapping for `key` if it exists in `collection`, otherwise return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2, "c"=>3);

julia> pop!(d, "d")
ERROR: KeyError: key "d" not found
Stacktrace:

```
```
popat!(a::Vector, i::Integer, [default])
```

Remove the item at the given `i` and return it. Subsequent items are shifted to fill the resulting gap. When `i` is not a valid index for `a`, return `default`, or throw an error if `default` is not specified.

See also: [`pop!`](@ref), [`popfirst!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref).

```

Pop the topmost backend off of the display-backend stack, or the topmost copy of `d` in the second variant.
```
popfirst!(collection) -> item

```
precision(num::AbstractFloat; base::Integer=2)
precision(T::Type; base::Integer=2)
```

Get the precision of a floating point number, as defined by the effective number of bits in the significand, or the precision of a floating-point type `T` (its current default, if `T` is a variable-precision type like [`BigFloat`](@ref)).

If `base` is specified, then it returns the maximum corresponding number of significand digits in that base.

precompile(f, args::Tuple{Vararg{Any}})
```

Compile the given function `f` for the argument tuple (of types) `args`, but do not execute it.
```
prepend!(a::Vector, collections...) -> collection
```

Insert the elements of each `collections` to the beginning of `a`.

When `collections` specifies multiple collections, order is maintained: elements of `collections[1]` will appear leftmost in `a`, and so on.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"

  * Case `n == 1`

    If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding starts before index `i`. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return the start of the previous character; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to `1` return `0`. If `i` is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1` return `lastindex(str)`. Otherwise throw `BoundsError`.
  * Case `n > 1`

    Behaves like applying `n` times `prevind` for `n==1`. The only difference is that if `n` is so large that applying `prevind` would reach `0` then each remaining iteration decreases the returned value by `1`. This means that in this case `prevind` can return a negative value.
  * Case `n == 0`

    Return `i` only if `i` is a valid index in `str` or is equal to `ncodeunits(str)+1`. Otherwise `StringIndexError` or `BoundsError` is thrown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevind("α", 3)
1

julia> prevind("α", 1)
0

julia> prevind("α", 0)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [0]
[...]

julia> prevind("α", 2, 2)
0

julia> prevind("α", 2, 3)
-1
```
```
prevpow(a, x)
```

The largest `a^n` not greater than `x`, where `n` is a non-negative integer. `a` must be greater than 1, and `x` must not be less than 1.

See also [`nextpow`](@ref), [`isqrt`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prevpow(2, 7)
4

julia> prevpow(2, 9)
8

julia> prevpow(5, 20)
5

julia> prevpow(4, 16)

```
```
print([io::IO], xs...)
```

Write to `io` (or to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref) if `io` is not given) a canonical (un-decorated) text representation. The representation used by `print` includes minimal formatting and tries to avoid Julia-specific details.

`print` falls back to calling `show`, so most types should just define `show`. Define `print` if your type has a separate "plain" representation. For example, `show` displays strings with quotes, and `print` displays strings without quotes.

See also [`println`](@ref), [`string`](@ref), [`printstyled`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> print(io, "Hello", ' ', :World!)

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello World!"
```
```
println([io::IO], xs...)
```

Print (using [`print`](@ref)) `xs` to `io` followed by a newline. If `io` is not supplied, prints to the default output stream [`stdout`](@ref).

See also [`printstyled`](@ref) to add colors etc.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> println("Hello, world")
Hello, world

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> println(io, "Hello", ',', " world.")

julia> String(take!(io))
"Hello, world.\n"
```
```
printstyled([io], xs...; bold::Bool=false, underline::Bool=false, blink::Bool=false, reverse::Bool=false, hidden::Bool=false, color::Union{Symbol,Int}=:normal)
```

Print `xs` in a color specified as a symbol or integer, optionally in bold.

Keyword `color` may take any of the values `:normal`, `:default`, `:bold`, `:black`, `:blink`, `:blue`, `:cyan`, `:green`, `:hidden`, `:light_black`, `:light_blue`, `:light_cyan`, `:light_green`, `:light_magenta`, `:light_red`, `:light_white`, `:light_yellow`, `:magenta`, `:nothing`, `:red`, `:reverse`, `:underline`, `:white`, or  `:yellow` or an integer between 0 and 255 inclusive. Note that not all terminals support 256 colors.

Keywords `bold=true`, `underline=true`, `blink=true` are self-explanatory. Keyword `reverse=true` prints with foreground and background colors exchanged, and `hidden=true` should be invisibe in the terminal but can still be copied. These properties can be used in any combination.

See also [`print`](@ref), [`println`](@ref), [`show`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Keywords except `color` and `bold` were added in Julia 1.7.

```
process_exited(p::Process)
```

Determine whether a process has exited.
```
process_running(p::Process)
```

Determine whether a process is currently running.
```
prod(f, itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of `f` applied to each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> prod(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
576
```

```
prod(itr; [init])
```

Returns the product of all elements of a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the multiplicative identity (i.e. one) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.

julia> prod(1:5)
120

julia> prod(1:5; init = 1.0)
120.0
```

```
prod(A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply elements of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(A, dims=1)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8

julia> prod(A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  2
 12
```

```
prod(f, A::AbstractArray; dims)
```

Multiply the results of calling the function `f` on each element of an array over the given dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=1)

 9  64

julia> prod(abs2, A, dims=2)
2×1 Matrix{Int64}:
   4
 144
```
```
prod!(r, A)
```

Multiply elements of `A` over the singleton dimensions of `r`, and write results to `r`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> prod!([1; 1], A)

  2
 12

julia> prod!([1 1], A)
1×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  8
```
```
promote(xs...)
```

Convert all arguments to a common type, and return them all (as a tuple). If no arguments can be converted, an error is raised.

See also: [`promote_type`], [`promote_rule`].

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote(Int8(1), Float16(4.5), Float32(4.1))
(1.0f0, 4.5f0, 4.1f0)
```
```
promote_rule(type1, type2)
```

Specifies what type should be used by [`promote`](@ref) when given values of types `type1` and `type2`. This function should not be called directly, but should have definitions added to it for new types as appropriate.
```
promote_shape(s1, s2)
```

Check two array shapes for compatibility, allowing trailing singleton dimensions, and return whichever shape has more dimensions.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = fill(1, (3,4,1,1,1));

julia> b = fill(1, (3,4));

julia> promote_shape(a,b)
(Base.OneTo(3), Base.OneTo(4), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1), Base.OneTo(1))

julia> promote_shape((2,3,1,4), (2, 3, 1, 4, 1))
(2, 3, 1, 4, 1)
```
```
promote_type(type1, type2)
```

Promotion refers to converting values of mixed types to a single common type. `promote_type` represents the default promotion behavior in Julia when operators (usually mathematical) are given arguments of differing types. `promote_type` generally tries to return a type which can at least approximate most values of either input type without excessively widening.  Some loss is tolerated; for example, `promote_type(Int64, Float64)` returns [`Float64`](@ref) even though strictly, not all [`Int64`](@ref) values can be represented exactly as `Float64` values.

See also: [`promote`](@ref), [`promote_typejoin`](@ref), [`promote_rule`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> promote_type(Int64, Float64)
Float64

julia> promote_type(Int32, Int64)
Int64

julia> promote_type(Float32, BigInt)
BigFloat

julia> promote_type(Int16, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int64, Float16)
Float16

julia> promote_type(Int8, UInt16)
UInt16
```

!!! warning "Don't overload this directly"
    To overload promotion for your own types you should overload [`promote_rule`](@ref). `promote_type` calls `promote_rule` internally to determine the type. Overloading `promote_type` directly can cause ambiguity errors.

```
propertynames(x, private=false)
```

Get a tuple or a vector of the properties (`x.property`) of an object `x`. This is typically the same as [`fieldnames(typeof(x))`](@ref), but types that overload [`getproperty`](@ref) should generally overload `propertynames` as well to get the properties of an instance of the type.

`propertynames(x)` may return only "public" property names that are part of the documented interface of `x`.   If you want it to also return "private" fieldnames intended for internal use, pass `true` for the optional second argument. REPL tab completion on `x.` shows only the `private=false` properties.

See also: [`hasproperty`](@ref), [`hasfield`](@ref).
```
push!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` in `collection`. If `collection` is an ordered container, the items are inserted at the end (in the given order).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> push!([1, 2, 3], 4, 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```

If `collection` is ordered, use [`append!`](@ref) to add all the elements of another collection to it. The result of the preceding example is equivalent to `append!([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])`. For `AbstractSet` objects, [`union!`](@ref) can be used instead.

See [`sizehint!`](@ref) for notes about the performance model.

See also [`pushfirst!`](@ref).
```
pushdisplay(d::AbstractDisplay)
```

Pushes a new display `d` on top of the global display-backend stack. Calling `display(x)` or `display(mime, x)` will display `x` on the topmost compatible backend in the stack (i.e., the topmost backend that does not throw a [`MethodError`](@ref)).
```
pushfirst!(collection, items...) -> collection
```

Insert one or more `items` at the beginning of `collection`.

This function is called `unshift` in many other programming languages.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> pushfirst!([1, 2, 3, 4], 5, 6)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 6
 1
 2
 3
 4
```
```
put!(c::Channel, v)
```

Append an item `v` to the channel `c`. Blocks if the channel is full.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`take!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `v` now gets converted to the channel's type with [`convert`](@ref) as `put!` is called.


```
put!(rr::Future, v)
```

Store a value to a [`Future`](@ref) `rr`. `Future`s are write-once remote references. A `put!` on an already set `Future` throws an `Exception`. All asynchronous remote calls return `Future`s and set the value to the return value of the call upon completion.

```
put!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Store a set of values to the [`RemoteChannel`](@ref). If the channel is full, blocks until space is available. Return the first argument.
```
pwd() -> AbstractString
```

Get the current working directory.

See also: [`cd`](@ref), [`tempdir`](@ref).

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser"

julia> cd("/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia")

julia> pwd()
"/home/JuliaUser/Projects/julia"
```
```
rad2deg(x)
```

Convert `x` from radians to degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rad2deg(pi)
180.0
```
```
rand([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [S], [dims...])
```

Pick a random element or array of random elements from the set of values specified by `S`; `S` can be

  * an indexable collection (for example `1:9` or `('x', "y", :z)`),
  * an `AbstractDict` or `AbstractSet` object,
  * a string (considered as a collection of characters), or
  * a type: the set of values to pick from is then equivalent to `typemin(S):typemax(S)` for integers (this is not applicable to [`BigInt`](@ref)), to $[0, 1)$ for floating point numbers and to $[0, 1)+i[0, 1)$ for complex floating point numbers;

`S` defaults to [`Float64`](@ref). When only one argument is passed besides the optional `rng` and is a `Tuple`, it is interpreted as a collection of values (`S`) and not as `dims`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    Support for `S` as a tuple requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> rand(Int, 2)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1339893410598768192
 1575814717733606317

julia> using Random

 0.696556  0.783855   0.938235
```

!!! note
    The complexity of `rand(rng, s::Union{AbstractDict,AbstractSet})` is linear in the length of `s`, unless an optimized method with constant complexity is available, which is the case for `Dict`, `Set` and dense `BitSet`s. For more than a few calls, use `rand(rng, collect(s))` instead, or either `rand(rng, Dict(s))` or `rand(rng, Set(s))` as appropriate.

```
randn([rng=GLOBAL_RNG], [T=Float64], [dims...])
```

Generate a normally-distributed random number of type `T` with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Optionally generate an array of normally-distributed random numbers. The `Base` module currently provides an implementation for the types [`Float16`](@ref), [`Float32`](@ref), and [`Float64`](@ref) (the default), and their [`Complex`](@ref) counterparts. When the type argument is complex, the values are drawn from the circularly symmetric complex normal distribution of variance 1 (corresponding to real and imaginary part having independent normal distribution with mean zero and variance `1/2`).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> using Random

julia> rng = MersenneTwister(1234);

julia> randn(rng, ComplexF64)
0.6133070881429037 - 0.6376291670853887im

```
```
range(start, stop, length)
range(start, stop; length, step)
range(start; length, stop, step)
range(;start, length, stop, step)
```

Construct a specialized array with evenly spaced elements and optimized storage (an [`AbstractRange`](@ref)) from the arguments. Mathematically a range is uniquely determined by any three of `start`, `step`, `stop` and `length`. Valid invocations of range are:

  * Call `range` with any three of `start`, `step`, `stop`, `length`.
  * Call `range` with two of `start`, `stop`, `length`. In this case `step` will be assumed to be one. If both arguments are Integers, a [`UnitRange`](@ref) will be returned.
  * Call `range` with one of `stop` or `length`. `start` and `step` will be assumed to be one.

See Extended Help for additional details on the returned type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, length=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, stop=100)
1:100

julia> range(1, step=5, length=100)
1:5:496

julia> range(1, step=5, stop=100)
1:5:96

julia> range(1, 10, length=101)
1.0:0.09:10.0

julia> range(1, 100, step=5)
1:5:96

julia> range(stop=10, length=5)
6:10

julia> range(stop=10, step=1, length=5)
6:1:10

julia> range(start=1, step=1, stop=10)
1:1:10

julia> range(; length = 10)
Base.OneTo(10)

julia> range(; stop = 6)
Base.OneTo(6)

julia> range(; stop = 6.5)
1.0:1.0:6.0
```

If `length` is not specified and `stop - start` is not an integer multiple of `step`, a range that ends before `stop` will be produced.

```jldoctest
julia> range(1, 3.5, step=2)
1.0:2.0:3.0
```

Special care is taken to ensure intermediate values are computed rationally. To avoid this induced overhead, see the [`LinRange`](@ref) constructor.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `stop` as a positional argument requires at least Julia 1.1.


!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    The versions without keyword arguments and `start` as a keyword argument require at least Julia 1.7.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The versions with `stop` as a sole keyword argument, or `length` as a sole keyword argument require at least Julia 1.8.


# Extended Help

```
rationalize([T<:Integer=Int,] x; tol::Real=eps(x))
```

Approximate floating point number `x` as a [`Rational`](@ref) number with components of the given integer type. The result will differ from `x` by no more than `tol`.

# Examples

```jldoctest

103//10

julia> typeof(numerator(a))

```
read(io::IO, T)
```

Read a single value of type `T` from `io`, in canonical binary representation.

Note that Julia does not convert the endianness for you. Use [`ntoh`](@ref) or [`ltoh`](@ref) for this purpose.

```
read(io::IO, String)
```

Read the entirety of `io`, as a `String` (see also [`readchomp`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization");

julia> read(io, String)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization"
```

```
read(filename::AbstractString, args...)
```

Open a file and read its contents. `args` is passed to `read`: this is equivalent to `open(io->read(io, args...), filename)`.

```
read(filename::AbstractString, String)
```

Read the entire contents of a file as a string.

```
read(s::IO, nb=typemax(Int))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

```
read(s::IOStream, nb::Integer; all=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `s`, returning a `Vector{UInt8}` of the bytes read.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.

```
read(command::Cmd)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as an array of bytes.

```
read(command::Cmd, String)
```

Run `command` and return the resulting output as a `String`.
```
read!(stream::IO, array::AbstractArray)
read!(filename::AbstractString, array::AbstractArray)
```

Read binary data from an I/O stream or file, filling in `array`.
```
readavailable(stream)
```

Read available buffered data from a stream. Actual I/O is performed only if no data has already been buffered. The result is a `Vector{UInt8}`.

!!! warning
    The amount of data returned is implementation-dependent; for example it can depend on the internal choice of buffer size. Other functions such as [`read`](@ref) should generally be used instead.

```
readbytes!(stream::IO, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b))
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

```
readbytes!(stream::IOStream, b::AbstractVector{UInt8}, nb=length(b); all::Bool=true)
```

Read at most `nb` bytes from `stream` into `b`, returning the number of bytes read. The size of `b` will be increased if needed (i.e. if `nb` is greater than `length(b)` and enough bytes could be read), but it will never be decreased.

If `all` is `true` (the default), this function will block repeatedly trying to read all requested bytes, until an error or end-of-file occurs. If `all` is `false`, at most one `read` call is performed, and the amount of data returned is device-dependent. Note that not all stream types support the `all` option.
```
readchomp(x)
```

Read the entirety of `x` as a string and remove a single trailing newline if there is one. Equivalent to `chomp(read(x, String))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end;

julia> readchomp("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members."

julia> rm("my_file.txt");
```
```
readdir(dir::AbstractString=pwd();
    join::Bool = false,
    sort::Bool = true,
) -> Vector{String}
```

Return the names in the directory `dir` or the current working directory if not given. When `join` is false, `readdir` returns just the names in the directory as is; when `join` is true, it returns `joinpath(dir, name)` for each `name` so that the returned strings are full paths. If you want to get absolute paths back, call `readdir` with an absolute directory path and `join` set to true.

By default, `readdir` sorts the list of names it returns. If you want to skip sorting the names and get them in the order that the file system lists them, you can use `readdir(dir, sort=false)` to opt out of sorting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `join` and `sort` keyword arguments require at least Julia 1.4.

Read a single line of text from the given I/O stream or file (defaults to `stdin`). When reading from a file, the text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. Lines in the input end with `'\n'` or `"\r\n"` or the end of an input stream. When `keep` is false (as it is by default), these trailing newline characters are removed from the line before it is returned. When `keep` is true, they are returned as part of the line.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readline("my_file.txt")
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> readline("my_file.txt", keep=true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```

```julia-repl
julia> print("Enter your name: ")
Enter your name:

julia> your_name = readline()
Logan
"Logan"
```
```
readlines(io::IO=stdin; keep::Bool=false)
readlines(filename::AbstractString; keep::Bool=false)
```

Read all lines of an I/O stream or a file as a vector of strings. Behavior is equivalent to saving the result of reading [`readline`](@ref) repeatedly with the same arguments and saving the resulting lines as a vector of strings.  See also [`eachline`](@ref) to iterate over the lines without reading them all at once.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readlines("my_file.txt")
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."
 "It has many members."

julia> readlines("my_file.txt", keep=true)
2-element Vector{String}:
 "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\n"
 "It has many members.\n"

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
readlink(path::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Return the target location a symbolic link `path` points to.
```
readuntil(stream::IO, delim; keep::Bool = false)
readuntil(filename::AbstractString, delim; keep::Bool = false)
```

Read a string from an I/O stream or a file, up to the given delimiter. The delimiter can be a `UInt8`, `AbstractChar`, string, or vector. Keyword argument `keep` controls whether the delimiter is included in the result. The text is assumed to be encoded in UTF-8.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> open("my_file.txt", "w") do io
           write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\nIt has many members.\n");
       end
57

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", 'L')
"Julia"

julia> readuntil("my_file.txt", '.', keep = true)
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization."

julia> rm("my_file.txt")
```
```
real(z)
```

Return the real part of the complex number `z`.

See also: [`imag`](@ref), [`reim`](@ref), [`complex`](@ref), [`isreal`](@ref), [`Real`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(1 + 3im)
1
```

```
real(T::Type)
```

Return the type that represents the real part of a value of type `T`. e.g: for `T == Complex{R}`, returns `R`. Equivalent to `typeof(real(zero(T)))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real(Complex{Int})
Int64

julia> real(Float64)
Float64
```

```
real(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return an array containing the real part of each entry in array `A`.

Equivalent to `real.(A)`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> real([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 0
 3

julia> real(fill(2 - im))
0-dimensional Array{Int64, 0}:
2
```
```
realpath(path::AbstractString) -> String
```

Canonicalize a path by expanding symbolic links and removing "." and ".." entries. On case-insensitive case-preserving filesystems (typically Mac and Windows), the filesystem's stored case for the path is returned.

(This function throws an exception if `path` does not exist in the filesystem.)

Boolean type, containing the values `true` and `false`.

`Bool` is a kind of number: `false` is numerically equal to `0` and `true` is numerically equal to `1`. Moreover, `false` acts as a multiplicative "strong zero":

```
redirect_stdio(;stdin=stdin, stderr=stderr, stdout=stdout)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`. Each argument must be an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


```
redirect_stdio(f; stdin=nothing, stderr=nothing, stdout=nothing)
```

Redirect a subset of the streams `stdin`, `stderr`, `stdout`, call `f()` and restore each stream.

Possible values for each stream are:

  * `nothing` indicating the stream should not be redirected.
  * `path::AbstractString` redirecting the stream to the file at `path`.
  * `io` an `IOStream`, `TTY`, `Pipe`, socket, or `devnull`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="stdout.txt", stderr="stderr.txt") do
           print("hello stdout")
           print(stderr, "hello stderr")
       end

julia> read("stdout.txt", String)
"hello stdout"

julia> read("stderr.txt", String)
"hello stderr"
```

# Edge cases

It is possible to pass the same argument to `stdout` and `stderr`:

```julia-repl
julia> redirect_stdio(stdout="log.txt", stderr="log.txt", stdin=devnull) do
    ...
end
```

However it is not supported to pass two distinct descriptors of the same file.

```julia-repl
julia> io1 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> io2 = open("same/path", "w")

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io1, stderr=io2) # not suppored
```

Also the `stdin` argument may not be the same descriptor as `stdout` or `stderr`.

```julia-repl
julia> io = open(...)

julia> redirect_stdio(f, stdout=io, stdin=io) # not supported
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    `redirect_stdio` requires Julia 1.7 or later.

```
redisplay(x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, x)
redisplay(mime, x)
redisplay(d::AbstractDisplay, mime, x)
```

By default, the `redisplay` functions simply call [`display`](@ref). However, some display backends may override `redisplay` to modify an existing display of `x` (if any). Using `redisplay` is also a hint to the backend that `x` may be redisplayed several times, and the backend may choose to defer the display until (for example) the next interactive prompt.
```
reduce(op, itr; [init])
```

Reduce the given collection `itr` with the given binary operator `op`. If provided, the initial value `init` must be a neutral element for `op` that will be returned for empty collections. It is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

For empty collections, providing `init` will be necessary, except for some special cases (e.g. when `op` is one of `+`, `*`, `max`, `min`, `&`, `|`) when Julia can determine the neutral element of `op`.

Reductions for certain commonly-used operators may have special implementations, and should be used instead: `maximum(itr)`, `minimum(itr)`, `sum(itr)`, `prod(itr)`,  `any(itr)`, `all(itr)`.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation dependent. This means that you can't use non-associative operations like `-` because it is undefined whether `reduce(-,[1,2,3])` should be evaluated as `(1-2)-3` or `1-(2-3)`. Use [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref) instead for guaranteed left or right associativity.

Some operations accumulate error. Parallelism will be easier if the reduction can be executed in groups. Future versions of Julia might change the algorithm. Note that the elements are not reordered if you use an ordered collection.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4])
24

julia> reduce(*, [2; 3; 4]; init=-1)
-24
```

```
reduce(f, A; dims=:, [init])
```

Reduce 2-argument function `f` along dimensions of `A`. `dims` is a vector specifying the dimensions to reduce, and the keyword argument `init` is the initial value to use in the reductions. For `+`, `*`, `max` and `min` the `init` argument is optional.

The associativity of the reduction is implementation-dependent; if you need a particular associativity, e.g. left-to-right, you should write your own loop or consider using [`foldl`](@ref) or [`foldr`](@ref). See documentation for [`reduce`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = reshape(Vector(1:16), (4,4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  5   9  13
 2  6  10  14
 3  7  11  15
 4  8  12  16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=2)
4×1 Matrix{Int64}:
 13
 14
 15
 16

julia> reduce(max, a, dims=1)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  8  12  16
```
```
reenable_sigint(f::Function)
```

Re-enable Ctrl-C handler during execution of a function. Temporarily reverses the effect of [`disable_sigint`](@ref).
```
reim(z)
```

Return a tuple of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number `z`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim(1 + 3im)
(1, 3)
```

```
reim(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return a tuple of two arrays containing respectively the real and the imaginary part of each entry in `A`.

Equivalent to `(real.(A), imag.(A))`, except that when `eltype(A) <: Real` `A` is returned without copying to represent the real part, and that when `A` has zero dimensions, a 0-dimensional array is returned (rather than a scalar).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reim([1, 2im, 3 + 4im])
([1, 0, 3], [0, 2, 4])

julia> reim(fill(2 - im))
(fill(2), fill(-1))
```
```
reinterpret(type, A)
```

Change the type-interpretation of a block of memory. For arrays, this constructs a view of the array with the same binary data as the given array, but with the specified element type. For example, `reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))` interprets the 4 bytes corresponding to `UInt32(7)` as a [`Float32`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32(7))
1.0f-44

julia> reinterpret(Float32, UInt32[1 2 3 4 5])
1×5 reinterpret(Float32, ::Matrix{UInt32}):
 1.0f-45  3.0f-45  4.0f-45  6.0f-45  7.0f-45
```

```
reinterpret(reshape, T, A::AbstractArray{S}) -> B
```

Change the type-interpretation of `A` while consuming or adding a "channel dimension."

If `sizeof(T) = n*sizeof(S)` for `n>1`, `A`'s first dimension must be of size `n` and `B` lacks `A`'s first dimension. Conversely, if `sizeof(S) = n*sizeof(T)` for `n>1`, `B` gets a new first dimension of size `n`. The dimensionality is unchanged if `sizeof(T) == sizeof(S)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.6.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int}, A)    # the result is a vector
2-element reinterpret(reshape, Complex{Int64}, ::Matrix{Int64}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 1 + 3im
 2 + 4im

julia> a = [(1,2,3), (4,5,6)]
2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}:
 (1, 2, 3)
 (4, 5, 6)

julia> reinterpret(reshape, Int, a)             # the result is a matrix
3×2 reinterpret(reshape, Int64, ::Vector{Tuple{Int64, Int64, Int64}}) with eltype Int64:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6
```
```
relpath(path::AbstractString, startpath::AbstractString = ".") -> AbstractString
```

Return a relative filepath to `path` either from the current directory or from an optional start directory. This is a path computation: the filesystem is not accessed to confirm the existence or nature of `path` or `startpath`.

On Windows, case sensitivity is applied to every part of the path except drive letters. If `path` and `startpath` refer to different drives, the absolute path of `path` is returned.
```
rem(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
mod(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
%(x::Integer, T::Type{<:Integer}) -> T
```

Find `y::T` such that `x` ≡ `y` (mod n), where n is the number of integers representable in `T`, and `y` is an integer in `[typemin(T),typemax(T)]`. If `T` can represent any integer (e.g. `T == BigInt`), then this operation corresponds to a conversion to `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 129 % Int8
-127
```

```
rem(x, y)
%(x, y)
```

Remainder from Euclidean division, returning a value of the same sign as `x`, and smaller in magnitude than `y`. This value is always exact.

See also: [`div`](@ref), [`mod`](@ref), [`mod1`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = 15; y = 4;

julia> x % y
3

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true

julia> rem.(-5:5, 3)'
1×11 adjoint(::Vector{Int64}) with eltype Int64:
 -2  -1  0  -2  -1  0  1  2  0  1  2
```

```
rem(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `y`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - y*round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is exact, and in the interval $[-|y|/2, |y|/2]$. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero` (default), then the result is exact, and in the interval $[0, |y|)$ if `x` is positive, or $(-|y|, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, y)$ if `y` is positive, or $(y, 0]$ otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have different signs, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval `(-y,0]` if `y` is positive, or `[0,-y)` otherwise. The result may not be exact if `x` and `y` have the same sign, and `abs(x) < abs(y)`. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples:

```jldoctest
julia> x = 9; y = 4;

julia> x % y  # same as rem(x, y)
1

julia> x ÷ y  # same as div(x, y)
2

julia> x == div(x, y) * y + rem(x, y)
true
```
```
rem2pi(x, r::RoundingMode)
```

Compute the remainder of `x` after integer division by `2π`, with the quotient rounded according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
x - 2π*round(x/(2π),r)
```

without any intermediate rounding. This internally uses a high precision approximation of 2π, and so will give a more accurate result than `rem(x,2π,r)`

  * if `r == RoundNearest`, then the result is in the interval $[-π, π]$. This will generally be the most accurate result. See also [`RoundNearest`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundToZero`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$ if `x` is positive,. or $[-2π, 0]$ otherwise. See also [`RoundToZero`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundDown`, then the result is in the interval $[0, 2π]$. See also [`RoundDown`](@ref).
  * if `r == RoundUp`, then the result is in the interval $[-2π, 0]$. See also [`RoundUp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rem2pi(7pi/4, RoundNearest)

```
```
repeat(A::AbstractArray, counts::Integer...)
```

Construct an array by repeating array `A` a given number of times in each dimension, specified by `counts`.

See also: [`fill`](@ref), [`Iterators.repeated`](@ref), [`Iterators.cycle`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 1
 2

julia> repeat([1, 2, 3], 2, 3)
6×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
 1  1  1
 2  2  2
 3  3  3
```

```
repeat(A::AbstractArray; inner=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)), outer=ntuple(Returns(1), ndims(A)))
```

Construct an array by repeating the entries of `A`. The i-th element of `inner` specifies the number of times that the individual entries of the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. The i-th element of `outer` specifies the number of times that a slice along the i-th dimension of `A` should be repeated. If `inner` or `outer` are omitted, no repetition is performed.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat(1:2, inner=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 1
 2
 2

julia> repeat(1:2, outer=2)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

 1  2  1  2  1  2
 3  4  3  4  3  4
 3  4  3  4  3  4
```

```
repeat(s::AbstractString, r::Integer)
```

Repeat a string `r` times. This can be written as `s^r`.

See also [`^`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat("ha", 3)
"hahaha"
```

```
repeat(c::AbstractChar, r::Integer) -> String
```

Repeat a character `r` times. This can equivalently be accomplished by calling [`c^r`](@ref :^(::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar}, ::Integer)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> repeat('A', 3)
"AAA"
```
```
replace(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of collection `A` where, for each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, all occurrences of `old` are replaced by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total.

The element type of the result is chosen using promotion (see [`promote_type`](@ref)) based on the element type of `A` and on the types of the `new` values in pairs. If `count` is omitted and the element type of `A` is a `Union`, the element type of the result will not include singleton types which are replaced with values of a different type: for example, `Union{T,Missing}` will become `T` if `missing` is replaced.

See also [`replace!`](@ref), [`splice!`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`insert!`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.

julia> replace([1, missing], missing=>0)
2-element Vector{Int64}:

```

```
replace(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Return a copy of `A` where each value `x` in `A` is replaced by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Version 1.7 is required to replace elements of a `Tuple`.

```

```
replace(s::AbstractString, pat=>r, [pat2=>r2, ...]; [count::Integer])
```

Search for the given pattern `pat` in `s`, and replace each occurrence with `r`. If `count` is provided, replace at most `count` occurrences. `pat` may be a single character, a vector or a set of characters, a string, or a regular expression. If `r` is a function, each occurrence is replaced with `r(s)` where `s` is the matched substring (when `pat` is a `AbstractPattern` or `AbstractString`) or character (when `pat` is an `AbstractChar` or a collection of `AbstractChar`). If `pat` is a regular expression and `r` is a [`SubstitutionString`](@ref), then capture group references in `r` are replaced with the corresponding matched text. To remove instances of `pat` from `string`, set `r` to the empty `String` (`""`).

Multiple patterns can be specified, and they will be applied left-to-right simultaneously, so only one pattern will be applied to any character, and the patterns will only be applied to the input text, not the replacements.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Support for multiple patterns requires version 1.7.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> replace("Python is a programming language.", "Python" => "Julia")
"Julia is a programming language."

julia> replace("The quick foxes run quickly.", "quick" => "slow", count=1)
"The slow foxes run quickly."

```
```
replace!(A, old_new::Pair...; [count::Integer])
```

For each pair `old=>new` in `old_new`, replace all occurrences of `old` in collection `A` by `new`. Equality is determined using [`isequal`](@ref). If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` occurrences in total. See also [`replace`](@ref replace(A, old_new::Pair...)).

# Examples

```

```
replace!(new::Function, A; [count::Integer])
```

Replace each element `x` in collection `A` by `new(x)`. If `count` is specified, then replace at most `count` values in total (replacements being defined as `new(x) !== x`).

```
```
replaceproperty!(x, f::Symbol, expected, desired, success_order::Symbol=:not_atomic, fail_order::Symbol=success_order)
```

Perform a compare-and-swap operation on `x.f` from `expected` to `desired`, per egal. The syntax `@atomic_replace! x.f expected => desired` can be used instead of the function call form.

See also [`replacefield!`](@ref Core.replacefield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
repr(x; context=nothing)
```

Create a string from any value using the [`show`](@ref) function. You should not add methods to `repr`; define a `show` method instead.

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

Note that `repr(x)` is usually similar to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.  See also [`repr(MIME("text/plain"), x)`](@ref) to instead return a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed more for human consumption, equivalent to the REPL display of `x`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.

julia> repr(1)
"1"

julia> repr(zeros(3))
"[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]"

julia> repr(big(1/3))
"0.333333333333333314829616256247390992939472198486328125"

julia> repr(big(1/3), context=:compact => true)
"0.333333"

```

```
repr(mime, x; context=nothing)
```

Returns an `AbstractString` or `Vector{UInt8}` containing the representation of `x` in the requested `mime` type, as written by [`show(io, mime, x)`](@ref) (throwing a [`MethodError`](@ref) if no appropriate `show` is available). An `AbstractString` is returned for MIME types with textual representations (such as `"text/html"` or `"application/postscript"`), whereas binary data is returned as `Vector{UInt8}`. (The function `istextmime(mime)` returns whether or not Julia treats a given `mime` type as text.)

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to `:key=>value` pair or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `show`.

As a special case, if `x` is an `AbstractString` (for textual MIME types) or a `Vector{UInt8}` (for binary MIME types), the `repr` function assumes that `x` is already in the requested `mime` format and simply returns `x`. This special case does not apply to the `"text/plain"` MIME type. This is useful so that raw data can be passed to `display(m::MIME, x)`.

In particular, `repr("text/plain", x)` is typically a "pretty-printed" version of `x` designed for human consumption.  See also [`repr(x)`](@ref) to instead return a string corresponding to [`show(x)`](@ref) that may be closer to how the value of `x` would be entered in Julia.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4];

julia> repr("text/plain", A)
"2×2 Matrix{Int64}:\n 1  2\n 3  4"
```
```
reset(s::IO)
```

Reset a stream `s` to a previously marked position, and remove the mark. Return the previously marked position. Throw an error if the stream is not marked.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`unmark`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).

```
reset(::Event)
```

Reset an Event back into an un-set state. Then any future calls to `wait` will block until `notify` is called again.
```
reshape(A, dims...) -> AbstractArray
reshape(A, dims) -> AbstractArray
```

Return an array with the same data as `A`, but with different dimension sizes or number of dimensions. The two arrays share the same underlying data, so that the result is mutable if and only if `A` is mutable, and setting elements of one alters the values of the other.

The new dimensions may be specified either as a list of arguments or as a shape tuple. At most one dimension may be specified with a `:`, in which case its length is computed such that its product with all the specified dimensions is equal to the length of the original array `A`. The total number of elements must not change.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:16)
16-element Vector{Int64}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7

julia> reshape(A, (4, 4))
4×4 Matrix{Int64}:

julia> reshape(A, 2, :)
2×8 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  3  5  7   9  11  13  15
 2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16

julia> reshape(1:6, 2, 3)
2×3 reshape(::UnitRange{Int64}, 2, 3) with eltype Int64:
 1  3  5
 2  4  6
```
```
resize!(a::Vector, n::Integer) -> Vector
```

Resize `a` to contain `n` elements. If `n` is smaller than the current collection length, the first `n` elements will be retained. If `n` is larger, the new elements are not guaranteed to be initialized.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> resize!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 5
 4

julia> a = resize!([6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 8);

julia> length(a)
8

julia> a[1:6]
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 6
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```
```
rethrow()
```

Rethrow the current exception from within a `catch` block. The rethrown exception will continue propagation as if it had not been caught.

!!! note
    The alternative form `rethrow(e)` allows you to associate an alternative exception object `e` with the current backtrace. However this misrepresents the program state at the time of the error so you're encouraged to instead throw a new exception using `throw(e)`. In Julia 1.1 and above, using `throw(e)` will preserve the root cause exception on the stack, as described in [`current_exceptions`](@ref).

```
retry(f;  delays=ExponentialBackOff(), check=nothing) -> Function
```

Return an anonymous function that calls function `f`.  If an exception arises, `f` is repeatedly called again, each time `check` returns `true`, after waiting the number of seconds specified in `delays`.  `check` should input `delays`'s current state and the `Exception`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    Before Julia 1.2 this signature was restricted to `f::Function`.


# Examples

```julia
retry(f, delays=fill(5.0, 3))
retry(f, delays=rand(5:10, 2))
retry(f, delays=Base.ExponentialBackOff(n=3, first_delay=5, max_delay=1000))
retry(http_get, check=(s,e)->e.status == "503")(url)
retry(read, check=(s,e)->isa(e, IOError))(io, 128; all=false)
```
```
reverse(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]] )
```

Return a copy of `v` reversed from start to stop.  See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy, and in-place [`reverse!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse(A)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1

julia> reverse(A, 1, 4)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 4
 3
 2
 1
 5

julia> reverse(A, 3, 5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 5
 4
 3
```

```
reverse(A; dims=:)
```

Reverse `A` along dimension `dims`, which can be an integer (a single dimension), a tuple of integers (a tuple of dimensions) or `:` (reverse along all the dimensions, the default).  See also [`reverse!`](@ref) for in-place reversal.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> b = Int64[1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> reverse(b, dims=2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  1
 4  3

julia> reverse(b)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Prior to Julia 1.6, only single-integer `dims` are supported in `reverse`.


```
reverse(s::AbstractString) -> AbstractString
```

Reverses a string. Technically, this function reverses the codepoints in a string and its main utility is for reversed-order string processing, especially for reversed regular-expression searches. See also [`reverseind`](@ref) to convert indices in `s` to indices in `reverse(s)` and vice-versa, and `graphemes` from module `Unicode` to operate on user-visible "characters" (graphemes) rather than codepoints. See also [`Iterators.reverse`](@ref) for reverse-order iteration without making a copy. Custom string types must implement the `reverse` function themselves and should typically return a string with the same type and encoding. If they return a string with a different encoding, they must also override `reverseind` for that string type to satisfy `s[reverseind(s,i)] == reverse(s)[i]`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("JuliaLang")
"gnaLailuJ"
```

!!! note
    The examples below may be rendered differently on different systems. The comments indicate how they're supposed to be rendered


Combining characters can lead to surprising results:

```jldoctest
julia> reverse("ax̂e") # hat is above x in the input, above e in the output
"êxa"

julia> using Unicode

julia> join(reverse(collect(graphemes("ax̂e")))) # reverses graphemes; hat is above x in both in- and output
"ex̂a"
```

```
reverse(o::Base.Ordering)
```

reverses ordering specified by `o`.
```
reverse!(v [, start=1 [, stop=length(v) ]]) -> v
```

In-place version of [`reverse`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = Vector(1:5)
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5

julia> reverse!(A);

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
```

```
reverse!(A; dims=:)
```

Like [`reverse`](@ref), but operates in-place in `A`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Multidimensional `reverse!` requires Julia 1.6.

```
reverseind(v, i)
```

Given an index `i` in [`reverse(v)`](@ref), return the corresponding index in `v` so that `v[reverseind(v,i)] == reverse(v)[i]`. (This can be nontrivial in cases where `v` contains non-ASCII characters.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> s = "Julia🚀"
"Julia🚀"

julia> r = reverse(s)
"🚀ailuJ"

julia> for i in eachindex(s)
           print(r[reverseind(r, i)])
       end
Julia🚀
```
```
rm(path::AbstractString; force::Bool=false, recursive::Bool=false)
```

Delete the file, link, or empty directory at the given path. If `force=true` is passed, a non-existing path is not treated as error. If `recursive=true` is passed and the path is a directory, then all contents are removed recursively.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> rm("my", recursive=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist", force=true)

julia> rm("this_file_does_not_exist")
ERROR: IOError: unlink("this_file_does_not_exist"): no such file or directory (ENOENT)
Stacktrace:

```
```
rot180(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1
```

```
rot180(A, k)
```

Rotate matrix `A` 180 degrees an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is even, this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rot180(a,1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 2  1

julia> rot180(a,2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
rotl90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` left 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 2  4
 1  3
```

```
rotl90(A, k)
```

Left-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees counterclockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotl90(a,1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:

julia> rotl90(a,4)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
rotr90(A)
```

Rotate matrix `A` right 90 degrees.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> rotr90(a)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  1
 4  2
```

```
rotr90(A, k)
```

Right-rotate matrix `A` 90 degrees clockwise an integer `k` number of times. If `k` is a multiple of four (including zero), this is equivalent to a `copy`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2; 3 4]

round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]])
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; digits=, base=10)
round(z::Complex[, RoundingModeReal, [RoundingModeImaginary]]; sigdigits=, base=10)
```

Return the nearest integral value of the same type as the complex-valued `z` to `z`, breaking ties using the specified [`RoundingMode`](@ref)s. The first [`RoundingMode`](@ref) is used for rounding the real components while the second is used for rounding the imaginary components.

# Example

```jldoctest
julia> round(3.14 + 4.5im)
3.0 + 4.0im
```

```
round([T,] x, [r::RoundingMode])
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; digits::Integer=0, base = 10)
round(x, [r::RoundingMode]; sigdigits::Integer, base = 10)
```

Rounds the number `x`.

Without keyword arguments, `x` is rounded to an integer value, returning a value of type `T`, or of the same type of `x` if no `T` is provided. An [`InexactError`](@ref) will be thrown if the value is not representable by `T`, similar to [`convert`](@ref).

If the `digits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of digits after the decimal place (or before if negative), in base `base`.

If the `sigdigits` keyword argument is provided, it rounds to the specified number of significant digits, in base `base`.

The [`RoundingMode`](@ref) `r` controls the direction of the rounding; the default is [`RoundNearest`](@ref), which rounds to the nearest integer, with ties (fractional values of 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer. Note that `round` may give incorrect results if the global rounding mode is changed (see [`rounding`](@ref)).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> round(1.7)
2.0

julia> round(Int, 1.7)
2

julia> round(1.5)
2.0

julia> round(2.5)
2.0

julia> round(pi; digits=2)
3.14

julia> round(pi; digits=3, base=2)
3.125

julia> round(123.456; sigdigits=2)
120.0

julia> round(357.913; sigdigits=4, base=2)
352.0
```

!!! note
    Rounding to specified digits in bases other than 2 can be inexact when operating on binary floating point numbers. For example, the [`Float64`](@ref) value represented by `1.15` is actually *less* than 1.15, yet will be rounded to 1.2. For example:

    ```jldoctest; setup = :(using Printf)
    julia> x = 1.15
    1.15

    julia> @sprintf "%.20f" x
    "1.14999999999999991118"

    julia> x < 115//100
    true

    julia> round(x, digits=1)
    1.2
    ```


# Extensions

To extend `round` to new numeric types, it is typically sufficient to define `Base.round(x::NewType, r::RoundingMode)`.

```
round(dt::TimeType, p::Period, [r::RoundingMode]) -> TimeType
```

Return the `Date` or `DateTime` nearest to `dt` at resolution `p`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 9:30 to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `p` may be a type instead of a value: `round(dt, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(dt, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Date(1985, 8, 16), Dates.Month)
1985-08-01

julia> round(DateTime(2013, 2, 13, 0, 31, 20), Dates.Minute(15))
2013-02-13T00:30:00

julia> round(DateTime(2016, 8, 6, 12, 0, 0), Dates.Day)
2016-08-07T00:00:00
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::TimeType, ::Period, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

```
round(x::Period, precision::T, [r::RoundingMode]) where T <: Union{TimePeriod, Week, Day} -> T
```

Round `x` to the nearest multiple of `precision`. If `x` and `precision` are different subtypes of `Period`, the return value will have the same type as `precision`. By default (`RoundNearestTiesUp`), ties (e.g., rounding 90 minutes to the nearest hour) will be rounded up.

For convenience, `precision` may be a type instead of a value: `round(x, Dates.Hour)` is a shortcut for `round(x, Dates.Hour(1))`.

```jldoctest
julia> round(Dates.Day(16), Dates.Week)
2 weeks

julia> round(Dates.Minute(44), Dates.Minute(15))
45 minutes

julia> round(Dates.Hour(36), Dates.Day)
2 days
```

Valid rounding modes for `round(::Period, ::T, ::RoundingMode)` are `RoundNearestTiesUp` (default), `RoundDown` (`floor`), and `RoundUp` (`ceil`).

Rounding to a `precision` of `Month`s or `Year`s is not supported, as these `Period`s are of inconsistent length.
```
rounding(T)
```

Get the current floating point rounding mode for type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion.

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available modes.
```
rpad(s, n::Integer, p::Union{AbstractChar,AbstractString}=' ') -> String
```

Stringify `s` and pad the resulting string on the right with `p` to make it `n` characters (in [`textwidth`](@ref)) long. If `s` is already `n` characters long, an equal string is returned. Pad with spaces by default.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> rpad("March", 20)
"March               "
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    In Julia 1.7, this function was changed to use `textwidth` rather than a raw character (codepoint) count.

```
rsplit(s::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
rsplit(s::AbstractString, chars; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
```

Similar to [`split`](@ref), but starting from the end of the string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "M.a.r.c.h"
"M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, ".")
5-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M"
 "a"
 "r"
 "c"
 "h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=1)
1-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c.h"

julia> rsplit(a, "."; limit=2)
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "M.a.r.c"
 "h"
```
```
rstrip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
rstrip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, or a vector or set of characters.

See also [`strip`](@ref) and [`lstrip`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = rpad("March", 20)
"March               "

julia> rstrip(a)
"March"
```
```
run(command, args...; wait::Bool = true)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual). Throws an error if anything goes wrong, including the process exiting with a non-zero status (when `wait` is true).

The `args...` allow you to pass through file descriptors to the command, and are ordered like regular unix file descriptors (eg `stdin, stdout, stderr, FD(3), FD(4)...`).

If `wait` is false, the process runs asynchronously. You can later wait for it and check its exit status by calling `success` on the returned process object.

When `wait` is false, the process' I/O streams are directed to `devnull`. When `wait` is true, I/O streams are shared with the parent process. Use [`pipeline`](@ref) to control I/O redirection.
No documentation found.

Binding `samefile` does not exist.
```
schedule(t::Task, [val]; error=false)
```

Add a [`Task`](@ref) to the scheduler's queue. This causes the task to run constantly when the system is otherwise idle, unless the task performs a blocking operation such as [`wait`](@ref).

If a second argument `val` is provided, it will be passed to the task (via the return value of [`yieldto`](@ref)) when it runs again. If `error` is `true`, the value is raised as an exception in the woken task.

!!! warning
    It is incorrect to use `schedule` on an arbitrary `Task` that has already been started. See [the API reference](@ref low-level-schedule-wait) for more information.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a5() = sum(i for i in 1:1000);

julia> b = Task(a5);

julia> istaskstarted(b)
false

julia> schedule(b);

julia> yield();

julia> istaskstarted(b)
true

julia> istaskdone(b)
true
```
```
searchsorted(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the range of indices of `a` which compare as equal to `x` (using binary search) according to the order specified by the `by`, `lt` and `rev` keywords, assuming that `a` is already sorted in that order. Return an empty range located at the insertion point if `a` does not contain values equal to `x`.

See also: [`insorted`](@ref), [`searchsortedfirst`](@ref), [`sort`](@ref), [`findall`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3:3

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4:5

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3:2

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7:6

julia> searchsorted([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1:0
```
```
searchsortedfirst(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the first value in `a` greater than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `lastindex(a) + 1` if `x` is greater than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

See also: [`searchsortedlast`](@ref), [`searchsorted`](@ref), [`findfirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches
4

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
3

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
7

julia> searchsortedfirst([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
1
```
```
searchsortedlast(a, x; by=<transform>, lt=<comparison>, rev=false)
```

Return the index of the last value in `a` less than or equal to `x`, according to the specified order. Return `firstindex(a) - 1` if `x` is less than all values in `a`. `a` is assumed to be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 4) # single match
3

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 5) # multiple matches

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 3) # no match, insert in the middle
2

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 9) # no match, insert at end
6

julia> searchsortedlast([1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 7], 0) # no match, insert at start
0
```

sec(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix secant of a square matrix `A`.
```
secd(x)
```

Compute the secant of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.
```
sech(x)
```

Compute the hyperbolic secant of `x`.

```
sech(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic secant of square matrix `A`.
```
seek(s, pos)
```

Seek a stream to the given position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
seekend(s)
```

Seek a stream to its end.
```
seekstart(s)
```

Seek a stream to its beginning.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> read(io, Char)
'L': ASCII/Unicode U+004C (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)

julia> seekstart(io);

julia> read(io, Char)
'J': ASCII/Unicode U+004A (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
selectdim(A, d::Integer, i)
```

Return a view of all the data of `A` where the index for dimension `d` equals `i`.

Equivalent to `view(A,:,:,...,i,:,:,...)` where `i` is in position `d`.

See also: [`eachslice`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2 3 4; 5 6 7 8]
2×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3) with eltype Int64:
 3
 7

julia> selectdim(A, 2, 3:4)
2×2 view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 3:4) with eltype Int64:
 3  4
 7  8
```
```
set_zero_subnormals(yes::Bool) -> Bool
```

If `yes` is `false`, subsequent floating-point operations follow rules for IEEE arithmetic on subnormal values ("denormals"). Otherwise, floating-point operations are permitted (but not required) to convert subnormal inputs or outputs to zero. Returns `true` unless `yes==true` but the hardware does not support zeroing of subnormal numbers.

`set_zero_subnormals(true)` can speed up some computations on some hardware. However, it can break identities such as `(x-y==0) == (x==y)`.

!!! warning
    This function only affects the current thread.

```
setcpuaffinity(original_command::Cmd, cpus) -> command::Cmd
```

Set the CPU affinity of the `command` by a list of CPU IDs (1-based) `cpus`.  Passing `cpus = nothing` means to unset the CPU affinity if the `original_command` has any.

This function is supported only in Linux and Windows.  It is not supported in macOS because libuv does not support affinity setting.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.8.


# Examples

In Linux, the `taskset` command line program can be used to see how `setcpuaffinity` works.

```julia
julia> run(setcpuaffinity(`sh -c 'taskset -p $$'`, [1, 2, 5]));
pid 2273's current affinity mask: 13
```

Note that the mask value `13` reflects that the first, second, and the fifth bits (counting from the least significant position) are turned on:

```julia
julia> 0b010011
0x13
```
```
setdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set of elements in `s` but not in any of the iterables in `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

See also [`setdiff!`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> setdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
setdiff!(s, itrs...)
```

Remove from set `s` (in-place) each element of each iterable from `itrs`. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([1, 3, 4, 5]);

julia> setdiff!(a, 1:2:6);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 1 element:
  4
```
```
setenv(command::Cmd, env; dir)
```

Set environment variables to use when running the given `command`. `env` is either a dictionary mapping strings to strings, an array of strings of the form `"var=val"`, or zero or more `"var"=>val` pair arguments. In order to modify (rather than replace) the existing environment, create `env` through `copy(ENV)` and then setting `env["var"]=val` as desired, or use [`addenv`](@ref).

The `dir` keyword argument can be used to specify a working directory for the command. `dir` defaults to the currently set `dir` for `command` (which is the current working directory if not specified already).

See also [`Cmd`](@ref), [`addenv`](@ref), [`ENV`](@ref), [`pwd`](@ref).
```
setindex!(collection, value, key...)
```

Store the given value at the given key or index within a collection. The syntax `a[i,j,...] = x` is converted by the compiler to `(setindex!(a, x, i, j, ...); x)`.

```
setindex!(A, X, inds...)
A[inds...] = X
```

Store values from array `X` within some subset of `A` as specified by `inds`. The syntax `A[inds...] = X` is equivalent to `(setindex!(A, X, inds...); X)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = zeros(2,2);

julia> setindex!(A, [10, 20], [1, 2]);

julia> A[[3, 4]] = [30, 40];

julia> A
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 10.0  30.0
 20.0  40.0
```
```
setprecision([T=BigFloat,] precision::Int; base=2)
```

Set the precision (in bits, by default) to be used for `T` arithmetic. If `base` is specified, then the precision is the minimum required to give at least `precision` digits in the given `base`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.


```
setprecision(f::Function, [T=BigFloat,] precision::Integer; base=2)
```

Change the `T` arithmetic precision (in the given `base`) for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = precision(BigFloat)
setprecision(BigFloat, precision)
f()
setprecision(BigFloat, old)
```

Often used as `setprecision(T, precision) do ... end`

Note: `nextfloat()`, `prevfloat()` do not use the precision mentioned by `setprecision`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    The `base` keyword requires at least Julia 1.8.

```
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x)
setproperty!(value, name::Symbol, x, order::Symbol)
```

The syntax `a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c)`. The syntax `@atomic order a.b = c` calls `setproperty!(a, :b, c, :order)` and the syntax `@atomic a.b = c` calls `getproperty(a, :b, :sequentially_consistent)`.

See also [`setfield!`](@ref Core.setfield!), [`propertynames`](@ref Base.propertynames) and [`getproperty`](@ref Base.getproperty).
```
setrounding(T, mode)
```

Set the rounding mode of floating point type `T`, controlling the rounding of basic arithmetic functions ([`+`](@ref), [`-`](@ref), [`*`](@ref), [`/`](@ref) and [`sqrt`](@ref)) and type conversion. Other numerical functions may give incorrect or invalid values when using rounding modes other than the default [`RoundNearest`](@ref).

Note that this is currently only supported for `T == BigFloat`.

!!! warning
    This function is not thread-safe. It will affect code running on all threads, but its behavior is undefined if called concurrently with computations that use the setting.


```
setrounding(f::Function, T, mode)
```

Change the rounding mode of floating point type `T` for the duration of `f`. It is logically equivalent to:

```
old = rounding(T)
setrounding(T, mode)
f()
setrounding(T, old)
```

See [`RoundingMode`](@ref) for available rounding modes.
```
show([io::IO = stdout], x)
```

Write a text representation of a value `x` to the output stream `io`. New types `T` should overload `show(io::IO, x::T)`. The representation used by `show` generally includes Julia-specific formatting and type information, and should be parseable Julia code when possible.

[`repr`](@ref) returns the output of `show` as a string.

To customize human-readable text output for objects of type `T`, define `show(io::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` instead. Checking the `:compact` [`IOContext`](@ref) property of `io` in such methods is recommended, since some containers show their elements by calling this method with `:compact => true`.

See also [`print`](@ref), which writes un-decorated representations.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> show("Hello World!")
"Hello World!"
julia> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```

```
show(io::IO, mime, x)
```

The [`display`](@ref) functions ultimately call `show` in order to write an object `x` as a given `mime` type to a given I/O stream `io` (usually a memory buffer), if possible. In order to provide a rich multimedia representation of a user-defined type `T`, it is only necessary to define a new `show` method for `T`, via: `show(io, ::MIME"mime", x::T) = ...`, where `mime` is a MIME-type string and the function body calls [`write`](@ref) (or similar) to write that representation of `x` to `io`. (Note that the `MIME""` notation only supports literal strings; to construct `MIME` types in a more flexible manner use `MIME{Symbol("")}`.)

For example, if you define a `MyImage` type and know how to write it to a PNG file, you could define a function `show(io, ::MIME"image/png", x::MyImage) = ...` to allow your images to be displayed on any PNG-capable `AbstractDisplay` (such as IJulia). As usual, be sure to `import Base.show` in order to add new methods to the built-in Julia function `show`.

Technically, the `MIME"mime"` macro defines a singleton type for the given `mime` string, which allows us to exploit Julia's dispatch mechanisms in determining how to display objects of any given type.

The default MIME type is `MIME"text/plain"`. There is a fallback definition for `text/plain` output that calls `show` with 2 arguments, so it is not always necessary to add a method for that case. If a type benefits from custom human-readable output though, `show(::IO, ::MIME"text/plain", ::T)` should be defined. For example, the `Day` type uses `1 day` as the output for the `text/plain` MIME type, and `Day(1)` as the output of 2-argument `show`.

Container types generally implement 3-argument `show` by calling `show(io, MIME"text/plain"(), x)` for elements `x`, with `:compact => true` set in an [`IOContext`](@ref) passed as the first argument.
```
showable(mime, x)
```

Returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object `x` can be written as the given `mime` type.

(By default, this is determined automatically by the existence of the corresponding [`show`](@ref) method for `typeof(x)`.  Some types provide custom `showable` methods; for example, if the available MIME formats depend on the *value* of `x`.)

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> showable(MIME("text/plain"), rand(5))
true

julia> showable("image/png", rand(5))
false
```
```
showerror(io, e)
```

Show a descriptive representation of an exception object `e`. This method is used to display the exception after a call to [`throw`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyException <: Exception
           msg::String
       end

julia> function Base.showerror(io::IO, err::MyException)
           print(io, "MyException: ")
           print(io, err.msg)
       end

julia> err = MyException("test exception")
MyException("test exception")

julia> sprint(showerror, err)
"MyException: test exception"

julia> throw(MyException("test exception"))
ERROR: MyException: test exception
```
```
sign(x)
```

Return zero if `x==0` and $x/|x|$ otherwise (i.e., ±1 for real `x`).

See also [`signbit`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref), [`copysign`](@ref), [`flipsign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sign(-4.0)
-1.0

julia> sign(99)
1

julia> sign(-0.0)
-0.0

julia> sign(0 + im)
0.0 + 1.0im
```
```
signbit(x)
```

Returns `true` if the value of the sign of `x` is negative, otherwise `false`.

See also [`sign`](@ref) and [`copysign`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signbit(-4)
true

julia> signbit(5)
false

julia> signbit(5.5)
false

julia> signbit(-4.1)
true
```
```
signed(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the signed type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> signed(UInt16)
Int16
julia> signed(UInt64)
Int64
```

```
signed(x)
```

Convert a number to a signed integer. If the argument is unsigned, it is reinterpreted as signed without checking for overflow.

See also: [`unsigned`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).
```
significand(x)
```

Extract the significand (a.k.a. mantissa) of a floating-point number. If `x` is a non-zero finite number, then the result will be a number of the same type and sign as `x`, and whose absolute value is on the interval $[1,2)$. Otherwise `x` is returned.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> significand(15.2)
1.9

julia> significand(-15.2)
-1.9

julia> significand(-15.2) * 2^3
-15.2

julia> significand(-Inf), significand(Inf), significand(NaN)
(-Inf, Inf, NaN)
```
```
similar(array, [element_type=eltype(array)], [dims=size(array)])
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array with the given element type and size, based upon the given source array. The second and third arguments are both optional, defaulting to the given array's `eltype` and `size`. The dimensions may be specified either as a single tuple argument or as a series of integer arguments.

Custom AbstractArray subtypes may choose which specific array type is best-suited to return for the given element type and dimensionality. If they do not specialize this method, the default is an `Array{element_type}(undef, dims...)`.

For example, `similar(1:10, 1, 4)` returns an uninitialized `Array{Int,2}` since ranges are neither mutable nor support 2 dimensions:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(1:10, 1, 4)
1×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 4419743872  4374413872  4419743888  0
```

Conversely, `similar(trues(10,10), 2)` returns an uninitialized `BitVector` with two elements since `BitArray`s are both mutable and can support 1-dimensional arrays:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(trues(10,10), 2)
2-element BitVector:
 0
 0
```

Since `BitArray`s can only store elements of type [`Bool`](@ref), however, if you request a different element type it will create a regular `Array` instead:

```julia-repl
julia> similar(falses(10), Float64, 2, 4)
2×4 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
 2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314  2.18425e-314
```

See also: [`undef`](@ref), [`isassigned`](@ref).

```
similar(storagetype, axes)
```

Create an uninitialized mutable array analogous to that specified by `storagetype`, but with `axes` specified by the last argument.

**Examples**:

```
similar(Array{Int}, axes(A))
```

creates an array that "acts like" an `Array{Int}` (and might indeed be backed by one), but which is indexed identically to `A`. If `A` has conventional indexing, this will be identical to `Array{Int}(undef, size(A))`, but if `A` has unconventional indexing then the indices of the result will match `A`.

```
similar(BitArray, (axes(A, 2),))
```

would create a 1-dimensional logical array whose indices match those of the columns of `A`.
```
sin(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

See also [`sind`], [`sinpi`], [`sincos`], [`cis`].

```
sin(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the sine. Otherwise, the sine is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sin(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649
```
```
sinc(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x) / (\pi x)$ if $x \neq 0$, and $1$ if $x = 0$.

See also [`cosc`](@ref), its derivative.
```
sincos(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in radians, returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

See also [`cis`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref).

```
sincos(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix sine and cosine of a square matrix `A`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> S, C = sincos(fill(1.0, (2,2)));

julia> S
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.454649  0.454649
 0.454649  0.454649

julia> C
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.291927  -0.708073
 -0.708073   0.291927
```
```
sincosd(x)
```

Simultaneously compute the sine and cosine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees.

!!! compat "Julia 1.3"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.3.

```
sincospi(x)
```

Simultaneously compute [`sinpi(x)`](@ref) and [`cospi(x)`](@ref) (the sine and cosine of `π*x`, where `x` is in radians), returning a tuple `(sine, cosine)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    This function requires Julia 1.6 or later.


See also: [`cispi`](@ref), [`sincosd`](@ref), [`sinpi`](@ref).
```
sind(x)
```

Compute sine of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
sinh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic sine of `x`.

```
sinh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic sine of a square matrix `A`.
```
sinpi(x)
```

Compute $\sin(\pi x)$ more accurately than `sin(pi*x)`, especially for large `x`.

See also [`sind`](@ref), [`cospi`](@ref), [`sincospi`](@ref).
```
size(A::AbstractArray, [dim])
```

Return a tuple containing the dimensions of `A`. Optionally you can specify a dimension to just get the length of that dimension.

Note that `size` may not be defined for arrays with non-standard indices, in which case [`axes`](@ref) may be useful. See the manual chapter on [arrays with custom indices](@ref man-custom-indices).

See also: [`length`](@ref), [`ndims`](@ref), [`eachindex`](@ref), [`sizeof`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (2,3,4));

julia> size(A)
(2, 3, 4)

julia> size(A, 2)
3
```
```
sizehint!(s, n)
```

Suggest that collection `s` reserve capacity for at least `n` elements. This can improve performance.

# Notes on the performance model

For types that support `sizehint!`,

1. `push!` and `append!` methods generally may (but are not required to) preallocate extra storage. For types implemented in `Base`, they typically do, using a heuristic optimized for a general use case.
2. `sizehint!` may control this preallocation. Again, it typically does this for types in `Base`.
3. `empty!` is nearly costless (and O(1)) for types that support this kind of preallocation.
```
sizeof(T::DataType)
sizeof(obj)
```

Size, in bytes, of the canonical binary representation of the given `DataType` `T`, if any. Or the size, in bytes, of object `obj` if it is not a `DataType`.

See also [`summarysize`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(Float32)
4

julia> sizeof(ComplexF64)
16

julia> sizeof(1.0)
8

julia> sizeof(collect(1.0:10.0))
80
```

If `DataType` `T` does not have a specific size, an error is thrown.

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof(AbstractArray)
ERROR: Abstract type AbstractArray does not have a definite size.
Stacktrace:
[...]
```

```
sizeof(str::AbstractString)
```

Size, in bytes, of the string `str`. Equal to the number of code units in `str` multiplied by the size, in bytes, of one code unit in `str`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sizeof("")
0

julia> sizeof("∀")
3
```
```
skip(s, offset)
```

Seek a stream relative to the current position.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer("JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> seek(io, 5);

julia> skip(io, 10);

julia> read(io, Char)
'G': ASCII/Unicode U+0047 (category Lu: Letter, uppercase)
```
```
skipchars(predicate, io::IO; linecomment=nothing)
```

Advance the stream `io` such that the next-read character will be the first remaining for which `predicate` returns `false`. If the keyword argument `linecomment` is specified, all characters from that character until the start of the next line are ignored.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> buf = IOBuffer("    text")
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> skipchars(isspace, buf)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=false, seekable=true, append=false, size=8, maxsize=Inf, ptr=5, mark=-1)

julia> String(readavailable(buf))
"text"
```
```
skipmissing(itr)
```

Return an iterator over the elements in `itr` skipping [`missing`](@ref) values. The returned object can be indexed using indices of `itr` if the latter is indexable. Indices corresponding to missing values are not valid: they are skipped by [`keys`](@ref) and [`eachindex`](@ref), and a `MissingException` is thrown when trying to use them.

Use [`collect`](@ref) to obtain an `Array` containing the non-`missing` values in `itr`. Note that even if `itr` is a multidimensional array, the result will always be a `Vector` since it is not possible to remove missings while preserving dimensions of the input.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`ismissing`](@ref), [`something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> x = skipmissing([1, missing, 2])
skipmissing(Union{Missing, Int64}[1, missing, 2])

julia> sum(x)
3

julia> x[1]
1

julia> x[2]
ERROR: MissingException: the value at index (2,) is missing
[...]

julia> argmax(x)
3

julia> collect(keys(x))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3

julia> collect(skipmissing([1, missing, 2]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> collect(skipmissing([1 missing; 2 missing]))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
```
```
sleep(seconds)
```

Block the current task for a specified number of seconds. The minimum sleep time is 1 millisecond or input of `0.001`.
```
something(x...)
```

Return the first value in the arguments which is not equal to [`nothing`](@ref), if any. Otherwise throw an error. Arguments of type [`Some`](@ref) are unwrapped.

See also [`coalesce`](@ref), [`skipmissing`](@ref), [`@something`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> something(nothing, 1)
1

julia> something(Some(1), nothing)
1

julia> something(missing, nothing)
missing

julia> something(nothing, nothing)
ERROR: ArgumentError: No value arguments present
```
```
sort(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Variant of [`sort!`](@ref) that returns a sorted copy of `v` leaving `v` itself unmodified.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> sort(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> v
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 3
 1
 2
```

```
sort(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort a multidimensional array `A` along the given dimension. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort(A, dims = 1)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 4  3

julia> sort(A, dims = 2)
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 3  4
 1  2
```
```
sort!(v; alg::Algorithm=defalg(v), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the vector `v` in place. [`QuickSort`](@ref) is used by default for numeric arrays while [`MergeSort`](@ref) is used for other arrays. You can specify an algorithm to use via the `alg` keyword (see [Sorting Algorithms](@ref) for available algorithms). The `by` keyword lets you provide a function that will be applied to each element before comparison; the `lt` keyword allows providing a custom "less than" function (note that for every `x` and `y`, only one of `lt(x,y)` and `lt(y,x)` can return `true`); use `rev=true` to reverse the sorting order. These options are independent and can be used together in all possible combinations: if both `by` and `lt` are specified, the `lt` function is applied to the result of the `by` function; `rev=true` reverses whatever ordering specified via the `by` and `lt` keywords.

# Examples

sort!(A; dims::Integer, alg::Algorithm=defalg(A), lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort the multidimensional array `A` along dimension `dims`. See [`sort!`](@ref) for a description of possible keyword arguments.

To sort slices of an array, refer to [`sortslices`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 3; 1 2]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  3
 1  2

julia> sort!(A, dims = 1); A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 4  3

julia> sort!(A, dims = 2); A
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```
```
sortperm(v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Return a permutation vector `I` that puts `v[I]` in sorted order. The order is specified using the same keywords as [`sort!`](@ref). The permutation is guaranteed to be stable even if the sorting algorithm is unstable, meaning that indices of equal elements appear in ascending order.

See also [`sortperm!`](@ref), [`partialsortperm`](@ref), [`invperm`](@ref), [`indexin`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2];

julia> p = sortperm(v)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortperm!(ix, v; alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward, initialized::Bool=false)
```

Like [`sortperm`](@ref), but accepts a preallocated index vector `ix`.  If `initialized` is `false` (the default), `ix` is initialized to contain the values `1:length(v)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> v = [3, 1, 2]; p = zeros(Int, 3);

julia> sortperm!(p, v); p
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
 1

julia> v[p]
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
```
```
sortslices(A; dims, alg::Algorithm=DEFAULT_UNSTABLE, lt=isless, by=identity, rev::Bool=false, order::Ordering=Forward)
```

Sort slices of an array `A`. The required keyword argument `dims` must be either an integer or a tuple of integers. It specifies the dimension(s) over which the slices are sorted.

E.g., if `A` is a matrix, `dims=1` will sort rows, `dims=2` will sort columns. Note that the default comparison function on one dimensional slices sorts lexicographically.

For the remaining keyword arguments, see the documentation of [`sort!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1) # Sort rows
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 -1   6  4
  7   3  5
  9  -2  8

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5
 -1   6  4

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; -1 6 4; 9 -2 8], dims=1, rev=true)
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  9  -2  8
  7   3  5
 -1   6  4

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2) # Sort columns
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  3   5  7
 -1  -4  6
 -2   8  9

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, alg=InsertionSort, lt=(x,y)->isless(x[2],y[2]))
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  5   3  7
 -4  -1  6
  8  -2  9

julia> sortslices([7 3 5; 6 -1 -4; 9 -2 8], dims=2, rev=true)
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 7   5   3
 6  -4  -1
 9   8  -2
```

# Higher dimensions

`sortslices` extends naturally to higher dimensions. E.g., if `A` is a a 2x2x2 array, `sortslices(A, dims=3)` will sort slices within the 3rd dimension, passing the 2x2 slices `A[:, :, 1]` and `A[:, :, 2]` to the comparison function. Note that while there is no default order on higher-dimensional slices, you may use the `by` or `lt` keyword argument to specify such an order.

If `dims` is a tuple, the order of the dimensions in `dims` is relevant and specifies the linear order of the slices. E.g., if `A` is three dimensional and `dims` is `(1, 2)`, the orderings of the first two dimensions are re-arranged such that the slices (of the remaining third dimension) are sorted. If `dims` is `(2, 1)` instead, the same slices will be taken, but the result order will be row-major instead.

# Higher dimensional examples

```
splice!(a::Vector, index::Integer, [replacement]) -> item
```

Remove the item at the given index, and return the removed item. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gap. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed item.

See also: [`replace`](@ref), [`delete!`](@ref), [`deleteat!`](@ref), [`pop!`](@ref), [`popat!`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]; splice!(A, 5)

julia> A
5-element Vector{Int64}:
 6

julia> A
7-element Vector{Int64}:

 -1
```

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

```
splice!(a::Vector, indices, [replacement]) -> items
```

Remove items at specified indices, and return a collection containing the removed items. Subsequent items are shifted left to fill the resulting gaps. If specified, replacement values from an ordered collection will be spliced in place of the removed items; in this case, `indices` must be a `AbstractUnitRange`.

To insert `replacement` before an index `n` without removing any items, use `splice!(collection, n:n-1, replacement)`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    Prior to Julia 1.5, `indices` must always be a `UnitRange`.


!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    Prior to Julia 1.8, `indices` must be a `UnitRange` if splicing in replacement values.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [-1, -2, -3, 5, 4, 3, -1]; splice!(A, 4:3, 2)

```
```
split(str::AbstractString, dlm; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=true)
split(str::AbstractString; limit::Integer=0, keepempty::Bool=false)
```

Split `str` into an array of substrings on occurrences of the delimiter(s) `dlm`.  `dlm` can be any of the formats allowed by [`findnext`](@ref)'s first argument (i.e. as a string, regular expression or a function), or as a single character or collection of characters.

If `dlm` is omitted, it defaults to [`isspace`](@ref).

The optional keyword arguments are:

  * `limit`: the maximum size of the result. `limit=0` implies no maximum (default)
  * `keepempty`: whether empty fields should be kept in the result. Default is `false` without a `dlm` argument, `true` with a `dlm` argument.

See also [`rsplit`](@ref), [`eachsplit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = "Ma.rch"
"Ma.rch"

julia> split(a, ".")
2-element Vector{SubString{String}}:
 "Ma"
 "rch"
```
```
splitdir(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

Split a path into a tuple of the directory name and file name.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitdir("/home/myuser")
("/home", "myuser")
```
```
splitdrive(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

On Windows, split a path into the drive letter part and the path part. On Unix systems, the first component is always the empty string.
```
splitext(path::AbstractString) -> (AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

If the last component of a path contains one or more dots, split the path into everything before the last dot and everything including and after the dot. Otherwise, return a tuple of the argument unmodified and the empty string. "splitext" is short for "split extension".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.jl")
("/home/myuser/example", ".jl")

julia> splitext("/home/myuser/example.tar.gz")
("/home/myuser/example.tar", ".gz")

julia> splitext("/home/my.user/example")
("/home/my.user/example", "")
```
```
splitpath(path::AbstractString) -> Vector{String}
```

Split a file path into all its path components. This is the opposite of `joinpath`. Returns an array of substrings, one for each directory or file in the path, including the root directory if present.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function requires at least Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> splitpath("/home/myuser/example.jl")
4-element Vector{String}:
 "/"
 "home"
 "myuser"
 "example.jl"
```
```
sprint(f::Function, args...; context=nothing, sizehint=0)
```

Call the given function with an I/O stream and the supplied extra arguments. Everything written to this I/O stream is returned as a string. `context` can be an [`IOContext`](@ref) whose properties will be used, a `Pair` specifying a property and its value, or a tuple of `Pair` specifying multiple properties and their values. `sizehint` suggests the capacity of the buffer (in bytes).

The optional keyword argument `context` can be set to a `:key=>value` pair, a tuple of `:key=>value` pairs, or an `IO` or [`IOContext`](@ref) object whose attributes are used for the I/O stream passed to `f`.  The optional `sizehint` is a suggested size (in bytes) to allocate for the buffer used to write the string.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Passing a tuple to keyword `context` requires Julia 1.7 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sprint(show, 66.66666; context=:compact => true)
"66.6667"

julia> sprint(showerror, BoundsError([1], 100))
"BoundsError: attempt to access 1-element Vector{Int64} at index [100]"
```
```
sqrt(x)
```

Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.

See also: [`hypot`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest; filter = r"Stacktrace:(\n \[[0-9]+\].*)*"
julia> sqrt(big(81))
9.0

julia> sqrt(big(-81))
ERROR: DomainError with -81.0:

```

```
sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

If `A` is real-symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root.   For such matrices, eigenvalues λ that appear to be slightly negative due to roundoff errors are treated as if they were zero. More precisely, matrices with all eigenvalues `≥ -rtol*(max |λ|)` are treated as semidefinite (yielding a Hermitian square root), with negative eigenvalues taken to be zero. `rtol` is a keyword argument to `sqrt` (in the Hermitian/real-symmetric case only) that defaults to machine precision scaled by `size(A,1)`.

Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor. If a real square root exists, then an extension of this method [^H87] that computes the real Schur form and then the real square root of the quasi-triangular factor is instead used.

Binding `stack` does not exist.
```
stacktrace([trace::Vector{Ptr{Cvoid}},] [c_funcs::Bool=false]) -> StackTrace
```

Returns a stack trace in the form of a vector of `StackFrame`s. (By default stacktrace doesn't return C functions, but this can be enabled.) When called without specifying a trace, `stacktrace` first calls `backtrace`.
```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::AbstractString)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with `prefix`. If `prefix` is a vector or set of characters, test whether the first character of `s` belongs to that set.

See also [`endswith`](@ref), [`contains`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", "Julia")
true
```

```
startswith(prefix)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument starts with `prefix`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> startswith(y, prefix)`.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(startswith)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    The single argument `startswith(prefix)` requires at least Julia 1.5.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith_julia = startswith("Julia");

julia> startswith_julia("Julia")
true

julia> startswith_julia("NotJulia")
false
```

```
startswith(s::AbstractString, prefix::Regex)
```

Return `true` if `s` starts with the regex pattern, `prefix`.

!!! note
    `startswith` does not compile the anchoring into the regular expression, but instead passes the anchoring as `match_option` to PCRE. If compile time is amortized, `occursin(r"^...", s)` is faster than `startswith(s, r"...")`.


See also [`occursin`](@ref) and [`endswith`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This method requires at least Julia 1.2.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> startswith("JuliaLang", r"Julia|Romeo")

```
```
stat(file)
```

Returns a structure whose fields contain information about the file. The fields of the structure are:

| inode   | The inode number of the file                                       |
| mode    | The protection mode of the file                                    |
| nlink   | The number of hard links to the file                               |
| uid     | The user id of the owner of the file                               |
| gid     | The group id of the file owner                                     |

```
step(r)
```

Get the step size of an [`AbstractRange`](@ref) object.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> step(1:10)
1

julia> step(1:2:10)
2

julia> step(2.5:0.3:10.9)
0.3

julia> step(range(2.5, stop=10.9, length=85))
0.1
```
```
stride(A, k::Integer)
```

Return the distance in memory (in number of elements) between adjacent elements in dimension `k`.

See also: [`strides`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> stride(A,2)
3

julia> stride(A,3)
12
```
```
strides(A)
```

Return a tuple of the memory strides in each dimension.

See also: [`stride`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = fill(1, (3,4,5));

julia> strides(A)
(1, 3, 12)
```
```
string(n::Integer; base::Integer = 10, pad::Integer = 1)
```

Convert an integer `n` to a string in the given `base`, optionally specifying a number of digits to pad to.

See also [`digits`](@ref), [`bitstring`](@ref), [`count_zeros`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string(5, base = 13, pad = 4)
"0005"

julia> string(-13, base = 5, pad = 4)
"-0023"
```

```
string(xs...)
```

Create a string from any values using the [`print`](@ref) function.

`string` should usually not be defined directly. Instead, define a method `print(io::IO, x::MyType)`. If `string(x)` for a certain type needs to be highly efficient, then it may make sense to add a method to `string` and define `print(io::IO, x::MyType) = print(io, string(x))` to ensure the functions are consistent.

See also: [`String`](@ref), [`repr`](@ref), [`sprint`](@ref), [`show`](@ref @show).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> string("a", 1, true)
"a1true"
```
```
strip([pred=isspace,] str::AbstractString) -> SubString
strip(str::AbstractString, chars) -> SubString
```

Remove leading and trailing characters from `str`, either those specified by `chars` or those for which the function `pred` returns `true`.

The default behaviour is to remove leading and trailing whitespace and delimiters: see [`isspace`](@ref) for precise details.

The optional `chars` argument specifies which characters to remove: it can be a single character, vector or set of characters.

See also [`lstrip`](@ref) and [`rstrip`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    The method which accepts a predicate function requires Julia 1.2 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> strip("{3, 5}\n", ['{', '}', '\n'])
"3, 5"
```
```
success(command)
```

Run a command object, constructed with backticks (see the [Running External Programs](@ref) section in the manual), and tell whether it was successful (exited with a code of 0). An exception is raised if the process cannot be started.
```
sum(f, itr; [init])
```

Sum the results of calling function `f` on each element of `itr`.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Keyword argument `init` requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> sum(abs2, [2; 3; 4])
29
```

Note the important difference between `sum(A)` and `reduce(+, A)` for arrays with small integer eltype:

```jldoctest
julia> sum(Int8[100, 28])
128

julia> reduce(+, Int8[100, 28])
-128
```

In the former case, the integers are widened to system word size and therefore the result is 128. In the latter case, no such widening happens and integer overflow results in -128.

```
sum(itr; [init])
```

Returns the sum of all elements in a collection.

The return type is `Int` for signed integers of less than system word size, and `UInt` for unsigned integers of less than system word size.  For all other arguments, a common return type is found to which all arguments are promoted.

The value returned for empty `itr` can be specified by `init`. It must be the additive identity (i.e. zero) as it is unspecified whether `init` is used for non-empty collections.

```
```
summary(io::IO, x)
str = summary(x)
```

Print to a stream `io`, or return a string `str`, giving a brief description of a value. By default returns `string(typeof(x))`, e.g. [`Int64`](@ref).

For arrays, returns a string of size and type info, e.g. `10-element Array{Int64,1}`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> summary(1)
"Int64"

julia> summary(zeros(2))
"2-element Vector{Float64}"
```
```
supertype(T::DataType)
```

Return the supertype of DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> supertype(Int32)
Signed
```
```
swapproperty!(x, f::Symbol, v, order::Symbol=:not_atomic)
```

The syntax `@atomic a.b, _ = c, a.b` returns `(c, swapproperty!(a, :b, c, :sequentially_consistent))`, where there must be one getfield expression common to both sides.

See also [`swapfield!`](@ref Core.swapfield!) and [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).
```
symdiff(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of elements in the passed in sets. When `s` is not an `AbstractSet`, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.

See also [`symdiff!`](@ref), [`setdiff`](@ref), [`union`](@ref) and [`intersect`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> symdiff([1,2,3], [3,4,5], [4,5,6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> symdiff([1,2,1], [2, 1, 2])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2

julia> symdiff(unique([1,2,1]), unique([2, 1, 2]))
Int64[]
```
```
symdiff!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the symmetric difference of the passed in sets, and overwrite `s` with the result. When `s` is an array, the order is maintained. Note that in this case the multiplicity of elements matters.
```
symlink(target::AbstractString, link::AbstractString; dir_target = false)
```

Creates a symbolic link to `target` with the name `link`.

On Windows, symlinks must be explicitly declared as referring to a directory or not.  If `target` already exists, by default the type of `link` will be auto- detected, however if `target` does not exist, this function defaults to creating a file symlink unless `dir_target` is set to `true`.  Note that if the user sets `dir_target` but `target` exists and is a file, a directory symlink will still be created, but dereferencing the symlink will fail, just as if the user creates a file symlink (by calling `symlink()` with `dir_target` set to `false` before the directory is created) and tries to dereference it to a directory.

Additionally, there are two methods of making a link on Windows; symbolic links and junction points.  Junction points are slightly more efficient, but do not support relative paths, so if a relative directory symlink is requested (as denoted by `isabspath(target)` returning `false`) a symlink will be used, else a junction point will be used.  Best practice for creating symlinks on Windows is to create them only after the files/directories they reference are already created.

See also: [`hardlink`](@ref).

!!! note
    This function raises an error under operating systems that do not support soft symbolic links, such as Windows XP.


!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    The `dir_target` keyword argument was added in Julia 1.6.  Prior to this, symlinks to nonexistant paths on windows would always be file symlinks, and relative symlinks to directories were not supported.

```
systemerror(sysfunc[, errno::Cint=Libc.errno()])
systemerror(sysfunc, iftrue::Bool)
```

Raises a `SystemError` for `errno` with the descriptive string `sysfunc` if `iftrue` is `true`
```
take!(b::IOBuffer)
```

Obtain the contents of an `IOBuffer` as an array. Afterwards, the `IOBuffer` is reset to its initial state.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."
```

```
take!(c::Channel)
```

Remove and return a value from a [`Channel`](@ref). Blocks until data is available.

For unbuffered channels, blocks until a [`put!`](@ref) is performed by a different task.

```
take!(rr::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Fetch value(s) from a [`RemoteChannel`](@ref) `rr`, removing the value(s) in the process.
```
tan(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in radians.

```
tan(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix tangent of a square matrix `A`.

If `A` is symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the tangent. Otherwise, the tangent is determined by calling [`exp`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tan(fill(1.0, (2,2)))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 -1.09252  -1.09252
 -1.09252  -1.09252
```
```
tand(x)
```

Compute tangent of `x`, where `x` is in degrees. If `x` is a matrix, `x` needs to be a square matrix.

!!! compat "Julia 1.7"
    Matrix arguments require Julia 1.7 or later.

```
tanh(x)
```

Compute hyperbolic tangent of `x`.

```
tanh(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

Compute the matrix hyperbolic tangent of a square matrix `A`.
```
task_local_storage(key)
```

Look up the value of a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(key, value)
```

Assign a value to a key in the current task's task-local storage.

```
task_local_storage(body, key, value)
```

Call the function `body` with a modified task-local storage, in which `value` is assigned to `key`; the previous value of `key`, or lack thereof, is restored afterwards. Useful for emulating dynamic scoping.
```
tempdir()
```

Gets the path of the temporary directory. On Windows, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMP`, `TEMP`, `USERPROFILE`. On all other operating systems, `tempdir()` uses the first environment variable found in the ordered list `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, `TEMP`, and `TEMPDIR`. If none of these are found, the path `"/tmp"` is used.
```
tempname(parent=tempdir(); cleanup=true) -> String
```

Generate a temporary file path. This function only returns a path; no file is created. The path is likely to be unique, but this cannot be guaranteed due to the very remote posibility of two simultaneous calls to `tempname` generating the same file name. The name is guaranteed to differ from all files already existing at the time of the call to `tempname`.

When called with no arguments, the temporary name will be an absolute path to a temporary name in the system temporary directory as given by `tempdir()`. If a `parent` directory argument is given, the temporary path will be in that directory instead.

The `cleanup` option controls whether the process attempts to delete the returned path automatically when the process exits. Note that the `tempname` function does not create any file or directory at the returned location, so there is nothing to cleanup unless you create a file or directory there. If you do and `clean` is `true` it will be deleted upon process termination.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The `parent` and `cleanup` arguments were added in 1.4. Prior to Julia 1.4 the path `tempname` would never be cleaned up at process termination.


!!! warning
    This can lead to security holes if another process obtains the same file name and creates the file before you are able to. Open the file with `JL_O_EXCL` if this is a concern. Using [`mktemp()`](@ref) is also recommended instead.

```
textwidth(c)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a character.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth('α')
1

julia> textwidth('⛵')
2
```

```
textwidth(s::AbstractString)
```

Give the number of columns needed to print a string.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> textwidth("March")
5
```
```
thisind(s::AbstractString, i::Integer) -> Int
```

If `i` is in bounds in `s` return the index of the start of the character whose encoding code unit `i` is part of. In other words, if `i` is the start of a character, return `i`; if `i` is not the start of a character, rewind until the start of a character and return that index. If `i` is equal to 0 or `ncodeunits(s)+1` return `i`. In all other cases throw `BoundsError`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> thisind("α", 0)
0

julia> thisind("α", 1)
1

julia> thisind("α", 2)
1

julia> thisind("α", 3)
3

julia> thisind("α", 4)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [4]
[...]

julia> thisind("α", -1)
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access 2-codeunit String at index [-1]
[...]
```
```
time(t::TmStruct)
```

Converts a `TmStruct` struct to a number of seconds since the epoch.

```
time()
```

Get the system time in seconds since the epoch, with fairly high (typically, microsecond) resolution.
```
time_ns()
```

Get the time in nanoseconds. The time corresponding to 0 is undefined, and wraps every 5.8 years.
```
timedwait(callback::Function, timeout::Real; pollint::Real=0.1)
```

Waits until `callback` returns `true` or `timeout` seconds have passed, whichever is earlier. `callback` is polled every `pollint` seconds. The minimum value for `timeout` and `pollint` is `0.001`, that is, 1 millisecond.

Returns :ok or :timed_out
```
titlecase(s::AbstractString; [wordsep::Function], strict::Bool=true) -> String
```

Capitalize the first character of each word in `s`; if `strict` is true, every other character is converted to lowercase, otherwise they are left unchanged. By default, all non-letters beginning a new grapheme are considered as word separators; a predicate can be passed as the `wordsep` keyword to determine which characters should be considered as word separators. See also [`uppercasefirst`](@ref) to capitalize only the first character in `s`.

See also [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> titlecase("the JULIA programming language")
"The Julia Programming Language"

julia> titlecase("ISS - international space station", strict=false)
"ISS - International Space Station"

julia> titlecase("a-a b-b", wordsep = c->c==' ')
"A-a B-b"
```
```
to_indices(A, I::Tuple)
```

Convert the tuple `I` to a tuple of indices for use in indexing into array `A`.

The returned tuple must only contain either `Int`s or `AbstractArray`s of scalar indices that are supported by array `A`. It will error upon encountering a novel index type that it does not know how to process.

For simple index types, it defers to the unexported `Base.to_index(A, i)` to process each index `i`. While this internal function is not intended to be called directly, `Base.to_index` may be extended by custom array or index types to provide custom indexing behaviors.

More complicated index types may require more context about the dimension into which they index. To support those cases, `to_indices(A, I)` calls `to_indices(A, axes(A), I)`, which then recursively walks through both the given tuple of indices and the dimensional indices of `A` in tandem. As such, not all index types are guaranteed to propagate to `Base.to_index`.
```
touch(path::AbstractString)
```

Update the last-modified timestamp on a file to the current time.

If the file does not exist a new file is created.

Return `path`.

# Examples

```julia-repl
julia> write("my_little_file", 2);

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.5273815391135583e9

julia> touch("my_little_file");

julia> mtime("my_little_file")
1.527381559163435e9
```

We can see the [`mtime`](@ref) has been modified by `touch`.
```
trailing_ones(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of ones trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_ones(3)
2
```
```
trailing_zeros(x::Integer) -> Integer
```

Number of zeros trailing the binary representation of `x`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trailing_zeros(2)
1
```
```
transcode(T, src)
```

Convert string data between Unicode encodings. `src` is either a `String` or a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-XX code units, where `XX` is 8, 16, or 32. `T` indicates the encoding of the return value: `String` to return a (UTF-8 encoded) `String` or `UIntXX` to return a `Vector{UIntXX}` of UTF-`XX` data. (The alias [`Cwchar_t`](@ref) can also be used as the integer type, for converting `wchar_t*` strings used by external C libraries.)

The `transcode` function succeeds as long as the input data can be reasonably represented in the target encoding; it always succeeds for conversions between UTF-XX encodings, even for invalid Unicode data.

Only conversion to/from UTF-8 is currently supported.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> str = "αβγ"
"αβγ"

julia> transcode(UInt16, str)
3-element Vector{UInt16}:
 0x03b1
 0x03b2
 0x03b3

julia> transcode(String, transcode(UInt16, str))
"αβγ"
```
```
transpose(A)
```

Lazy transpose. Mutating the returned object should appropriately mutate `A`. Often, but not always, yields `Transpose(A)`, where `Transpose` is a lazy transpose wrapper. Note that this operation is recursive.

This operation is intended for linear algebra usage - for general data manipulation see [`permutedims`](@ref Base.permutedims), which is non-recursive.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [3+2im 9+2im; 8+7im  4+6im]
2×2 Matrix{Complex{Int64}}:
 3+2im  9+2im
 8+7im  4+6im

julia> transpose(A)
2×2 transpose(::Matrix{Complex{Int64}}) with eltype Complex{Int64}:
 3+2im  8+7im
 9+2im  4+6im
```
```
trues(dims)
```

Create a `BitArray` with all values set to `true`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trues(2,3)
2×3 BitMatrix:
 1  1  1
 1  1  1
```
```
trunc([T,] x)
trunc(x; digits::Integer= [, base = 10])
trunc(x; sigdigits::Integer= [, base = 10])
```

`trunc(x)` returns the nearest integral value of the same type as `x` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`.

`trunc(T, x)` converts the result to type `T`, throwing an `InexactError` if the value is not representable.

Keywords `digits`, `sigdigits` and `base` work as for [`round`](@ref).

See also: [`%`](@ref rem), [`floor`](@ref), [`unsigned`](@ref), [`unsafe_trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(2.22)
2.0

julia> trunc(-2.22, digits=1)
-2.2

julia> trunc(Int, -2.22)
-2
```

```
trunc(dt::TimeType, ::Type{Period}) -> TimeType
```

Truncates the value of `dt` according to the provided `Period` type.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> trunc(Dates.DateTime("1996-01-01T12:30:00"), Dates.Day)
1996-01-01T00:00:00
```
```
truncate(file, n)
```

Resize the file or buffer given by the first argument to exactly `n` bytes, filling previously unallocated space with '\0' if the file or buffer is grown.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.")
35

julia> truncate(io, 15)
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=15, maxsize=Inf, ptr=16, mark=-1)

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a "

julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.");

julia> truncate(io, 40);

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.\0\0\0\0\0"
```
```
trylock(lock) -> Success (Boolean)
```

Acquire the lock if it is available, and return `true` if successful. If the lock is already locked by a different task/thread, return `false`.

Each successful `trylock` must be matched by an [`unlock`](@ref).
```
tryparse(type, str; base)
```

Like [`parse`](@ref), but returns either a value of the requested type, or [`nothing`](@ref) if the string does not contain a valid number.
```
typeintersect(T::Type, S::Type)
```

Compute a type that contains the intersection of `T` and `S`. Usually this will be the smallest such type or one close to it.
```
typejoin(T, S)
```

Return the closest common ancestor of `T` and `S`, i.e. the narrowest type from which they both inherit.
```
typemax(T)
```

The highest value representable by the given (real) numeric `DataType`.

See also: [`floatmax`](@ref), [`typemin`](@ref), [`eps`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemax(Int8)
127

julia> typemax(UInt32)
0xffffffff

julia> typemax(Float64)
Inf

julia> floatmax(Float32)  # largest finite floating point number
3.4028235f38
```
```
typemin(T)
```

The lowest value representable by the given (real) numeric DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typemin(Float16)
-Inf16

julia> typemin(Float32)
-Inf32
```
```
unescape_string(str::AbstractString, keep = ())::AbstractString
unescape_string(io, s::AbstractString, keep = ())::Nothing
```

General unescaping of traditional C and Unicode escape sequences. The first form returns the escaped string, the second prints the result to `io`. The argument `keep` specifies a collection of characters which (along with backlashes) are to be kept as they are.

The following escape sequences are recognised:

  * Escaped backslash (`\\`)
  * Escaped double-quote (`\"`)
  * Standard C escape sequences (`\a`, `\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\v`, `\f`, `\r`, `\e`)
  * Unicode BMP code points (`\u` with 1-4 trailing hex digits)
  * All Unicode code points (`\U` with 1-8 trailing hex digits; max value = 0010ffff)
  * Hex bytes (`\x` with 1-2 trailing hex digits)
  * Octal bytes (`\` with 1-3 trailing octal digits)

See also [`escape_string`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unescape_string("aaa\\nbbb") # C escape sequence
"aaa\nbbb"

julia> unescape_string("\\u03c0") # unicode
"π"

julia> unescape_string("\\101") # octal
"A"

julia> unescape_string("aaa \\g \\n", ['g']) # using `keep` argument
"aaa \\g \n"
```
```
union(s, itrs...)
∪(s, itrs...)
```

Construct an object containing all distinct elements from all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∪` can be typed by writing `\cup` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∪ itr`.

See also [`unique`](@ref), [`intersect`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`vcat`](@ref), [`Iterators.flatten`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> union([1, 2], [3])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> union([4 2 3 4 4], 1:3, 3.0)
4-element Vector{Float64}:
 4.0
 2.0
 3.0
 1.0

julia> (0, 0.0) ∪ (-0.0, NaN)
3-element Vector{Real}:
   0
  -0.0
 NaN

julia> union(Set([1, 2]), 2:3)
Set{Int64} with 3 elements:
  2
  3
  1
```
```
union!(s::Union{AbstractSet,AbstractVector}, itrs...)
```

Construct the [`union`](@ref) of passed in sets and overwrite `s` with the result. Maintain order with arrays.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = Set([3, 4, 5]);

julia> union!(a, 1:2:7);

julia> a
Set{Int64} with 5 elements:
  5
  4
  7
  3
  1
```
```
unique(itr)
```

Return an array containing only the unique elements of collection `itr`, as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), in the order that the first of each set of equivalent elements originally appears. The element type of the input is preserved.

See also: [`unique!`](@ref), [`allunique`](@ref), [`allequal`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique([1, 2, 6, 2])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 6

julia> unique(Real[1, 1.0, 2])
2-element Vector{Real}:
 1
 2
```

```
unique(f, itr)
```

Returns an array containing one value from `itr` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `itr`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4
```

```
unique(A::AbstractArray; dims::Int)
```

Return unique regions of `A` along dimension `dims`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = map(isodd, reshape(Vector(1:8), (2,2,2)))
2×2×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0

[:, :, 2] =
 1  1
 0  0

julia> unique(A)
2-element Vector{Bool}:
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=2)
2×1×2 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1
 0

[:, :, 2] =
 1
 0

julia> unique(A, dims=3)
2×2×1 Array{Bool, 3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 1  1
 0  0
```
```
unique!(f, A::AbstractVector)
```

Selects one value from `A` for each unique value produced by `f` applied to elements of `A`, then return the modified A.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This method is available as of Julia 1.1.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!(x -> x^2, [1, -1, 3, -3, 4])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 3
 4

julia> unique!(n -> n%3, [5, 1, 8, 9, 3, 4, 10, 7, 2, 6])
3-element Vector{Int64}:
 5
 1
 9

julia> unique!(iseven, [2, 3, 5, 7, 9])
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```

```
unique!(A::AbstractVector)
```

Remove duplicate items as determined by [`isequal`](@ref), then return the modified `A`. `unique!` will return the elements of `A` in the order that they occur. If you do not care about the order of the returned data, then calling `(sort!(A); unique!(A))` will be much more efficient as long as the elements of `A` can be sorted.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unique!([1, 1, 1])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 1

julia> A = [7, 3, 2, 3, 7, 5];

julia> unique!(A)
4-element Vector{Int64}:
 7
 3
 2
 5

julia> B = [7, 6, 42, 6, 7, 42];

julia> sort!(B);  # unique! is able to process sorted data much more efficiently.

julia> unique!(B)
3-element Vector{Int64}:
  6
  7
 42
```
```
unlock(lock)
```

Releases ownership of the `lock`.

If this is a recursive lock which has been acquired before, decrement an internal counter and return immediately.
```
unmark(s::IO)
```

Remove a mark from stream `s`. Return `true` if the stream was marked, `false` otherwise.

See also [`mark`](@ref), [`reset`](@ref), [`ismarked`](@ref).
```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Ptr{T}, src::Ptr{T}, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source pointer to a destination, with no checking. The size of an element is determined by the type of the pointers.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointers `dest` and `src` to ensure that they are valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.

```
unsafe_copyto!(dest::Array, do, src::Array, so, N)
```

Copy `N` elements from a source array to a destination, starting at offset `so` in the source and `do` in the destination (1-indexed).

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed to ensure that N is inbounds on either array. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_load(p::Ptr{T}, i::Integer=1)
```

Load a value of type `T` from the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1]`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may segfault your program or return garbage answers, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_pointer_to_objref(p::Ptr)
```

Convert a `Ptr` to an object reference. Assumes the pointer refers to a valid heap-allocated Julia object. If this is not the case, undefined behavior results, hence this function is considered "unsafe" and should be used with care.

See also [`pointer_from_objref`](@ref).
```
unsafe_read(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from the `IO` stream object into `ref` (converted to a pointer).

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_read(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsafe_store!(p::Ptr{T}, x, i::Integer=1)
```

Store a value of type `T` to the address of the `i`th element (1-indexed) starting at `p`. This is equivalent to the C expression `p[i-1] = x`.

The `unsafe` prefix on this function indicates that no validation is performed on the pointer `p` to ensure that it is valid. Incorrect usage may corrupt or segfault your program, in the same manner as C.
```
unsafe_string(p::Ptr{UInt8}, [length::Integer])
```

Copy a string from the address of a C-style (NUL-terminated) string encoded as UTF-8. (The pointer can be safely freed afterwards.) If `length` is specified (the length of the data in bytes), the string does not have to be NUL-terminated.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `p` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_trunc(T, x)
```

Return the nearest integral value of type `T` whose absolute value is less than or equal to the absolute value of `x`. If the value is not representable by `T`, an arbitrary value will be returned. See also [`trunc`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, -2.2)
-2

julia> unsafe_trunc(Int, NaN)
-9223372036854775808
```
```
unsafe_wrap(Array, pointer::Ptr{T}, dims; own = false)
```

Wrap a Julia `Array` object around the data at the address given by `pointer`, without making a copy.  The pointer element type `T` determines the array element type. `dims` is either an integer (for a 1d array) or a tuple of the array dimensions. `own` optionally specifies whether Julia should take ownership of the memory, calling `free` on the pointer when the array is no longer referenced.

This function is labeled "unsafe" because it will crash if `pointer` is not a valid memory address to data of the requested length.
```
unsafe_write(io::IO, ref, nbytes::UInt)
```

Copy `nbytes` from `ref` (converted to a pointer) into the `IO` object.

It is recommended that subtypes `T<:IO` override the following method signature to provide more efficient implementations: `unsafe_write(s::T, p::Ptr{UInt8}, n::UInt)`
```
unsigned(T::Integer)
```

Convert an integer bitstype to the unsigned type of the same size.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(Int16)
UInt16
julia> unsigned(UInt64)
UInt64
```

```
unsigned(x)
```

Convert a number to an unsigned integer. If the argument is signed, it is reinterpreted as unsigned without checking for negative values.

See also: [`signed`](@ref), [`sign`](@ref), [`signbit`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> unsigned(-2)
0xfffffffffffffffe

julia> unsigned(2)
0x0000000000000002

julia> signed(unsigned(-2))
-2
```
```
uperm(file)
```

Get the permissions of the owner of the file as a bitfield of

| Value | Description        |
|:----- |:------------------ |
| 01    | Execute Permission |
| 02    | Write Permission   |
| 04    | Read Permission    |

For allowed arguments, see [`stat`](@ref).
```
uppercase(s::AbstractString)
```

Return `s` with all characters converted to uppercase.

See also [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref), [`uppercasefirst`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercase("Julia")
"JULIA"
```
```
uppercasefirst(s::AbstractString) -> String
```

Return `s` with the first character converted to uppercase (technically "title case" for Unicode). See also [`titlecase`](@ref) to capitalize the first character of every word in `s`.

See also [`lowercasefirst`](@ref), [`uppercase`](@ref), [`lowercase`](@ref), [`titlecase`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> uppercasefirst("python")
"Python"
```
```
valtype(T::Type{<:AbstractArray})
valtype(A::AbstractArray)
```

Return the value type of an array. This is identical to `eltype` and is provided mainly for compatibility with the dictionary interface.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(["one", "two", "three"])
String
```

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    For arrays, this function requires at least Julia 1.2.


```
valtype(type)
```

Get the value type of a dictionary type. Behaves similarly to [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> valtype(Dict(Int32(1) => "foo"))
String
```
```
values(iterator)
```

For an iterator or collection that has keys and values, return an iterator over the values. This function simply returns its argument by default, since the elements of a general iterator are normally considered its "values".

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> d = Dict("a"=>1, "b"=>2);

julia> values(d)
ValueIterator for a Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries. Values:
  2
  1

julia> values([2])
1-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
```

```
values(a::AbstractDict)
```

Return an iterator over all values in a collection. `collect(values(a))` returns an array of values. When the values are stored internally in a hash table, as is the case for `Dict`, the order in which they are returned may vary. But `keys(a)` and `values(a)` both iterate `a` and return the elements in the same order.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> D = Dict('a'=>2, 'b'=>3)
Dict{Char, Int64} with 2 entries:
  'a' => 2
  'b' => 3

julia> collect(values(D))
2-element Vector{Int64}:
 2
 3
```
```
vcat(A...)
```

Concatenate along dimension 1. To efficiently concatenate a large vector of arrays, use `reduce(vcat, x)`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3 4 5]
1×5 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3  4  5

julia> b = [6 7 8 9 10; 11 12 13 14 15]
2×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> vcat(a,b)
3×5 Matrix{Int64}:
  1   2   3   4   5
  6   7   8   9  10
 11  12  13  14  15

julia> c = ([1 2 3], [4 5 6])
([1 2 3], [4 5 6])

julia> vcat(c...)
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vs = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
3-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [1, 2]
 [3, 4]
 [5, 6]

julia> reduce(vcat, vs)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
```
```
vec(a::AbstractArray) -> AbstractVector
```

Reshape the array `a` as a one-dimensional column vector. Return `a` if it is already an `AbstractVector`. The resulting array shares the same underlying data as `a`, so it will only be mutable if `a` is mutable, in which case modifying one will also modify the other.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6

julia> vec(a)
6-element Vector{Int64}:
 1
 4
 2
 5
 3
 6

julia> vec(1:3)
1:3
```

See also [`reshape`](@ref), [`dropdims`](@ref).
```
view(A, inds...)
```

Like [`getindex`](@ref), but returns a lightweight array that lazily references (or is effectively a *view* into) the parent array `A` at the given index or indices `inds` instead of eagerly extracting elements or constructing a copied subset. Calling [`getindex`](@ref) or [`setindex!`](@ref) on the returned value (often a [`SubArray`](@ref)) computes the indices to access or modify the parent array on the fly.  The behavior is undefined if the shape of the parent array is changed after `view` is called because there is no bound check for the parent array; e.g., it may cause a segmentation fault.

Some immutable parent arrays (like ranges) may choose to simply recompute a new array in some circumstances instead of returning a `SubArray` if doing so is efficient and provides compatible semantics.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    In Julia 1.6 or later, `view` can be called on an `AbstractString`, returning a `SubString`.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [1 2; 3 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4

julia> b = view(A, :, 1)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 1
 3

julia> fill!(b, 0)
2-element view(::Matrix{Int64}, :, 1) with eltype Int64:
 0
 0

julia> A # Note A has changed even though we modified b
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  2
 0  4

julia> view(2:5, 2:3) # returns a range as type is immutable
3:4
```
```
wait([x])
```

Block the current task until some event occurs, depending on the type of the argument:

  * [`Channel`](@ref): Wait for a value to be appended to the channel.
  * [`Condition`](@ref): Wait for [`notify`](@ref) on a condition and return the `val` parameter passed to `notify`.
  * `Process`: Wait for a process or process chain to exit. The `exitcode` field of a process can be used to determine success or failure.
  * [`Task`](@ref): Wait for a `Task` to finish. If the task fails with an exception, a `TaskFailedException` (which wraps the failed task) is thrown.
  * [`RawFD`](@ref): Wait for changes on a file descriptor (see the `FileWatching` package).

If no argument is passed, the task blocks for an undefined period. A task can only be restarted by an explicit call to [`schedule`](@ref) or [`yieldto`](@ref).

Often `wait` is called within a `while` loop to ensure a waited-for condition is met before proceeding.

Special note for [`Threads.Condition`](@ref):

The caller must be holding the [`lock`](@ref) that owns a `Threads.Condition` before calling this method. The calling task will be blocked until some other task wakes it, usually by calling [`notify`](@ref) on the same `Threads.Condition` object. The lock will be atomically released when blocking (even if it was locked recursively), and will be reacquired before returning.

```
wait(r::Future)
```

Wait for a value to become available for the specified [`Future`](@ref).

```
wait(r::RemoteChannel, args...)
```

Wait for a value to become available on the specified [`RemoteChannel`](@ref).
```
walkdir(dir; topdown=true, follow_symlinks=false, onerror=throw)
```

Return an iterator that walks the directory tree of a directory. The iterator returns a tuple containing `(rootpath, dirs, files)`. The directory tree can be traversed top-down or bottom-up. If `walkdir` or `stat` encounters a `IOError` it will rethrow the error by default. A custom error handling function can be provided through `onerror` keyword argument. `onerror` is called with a `IOError` as argument.

# Examples

```julia
for (root, dirs, files) in walkdir(".")
    println("Directories in $root")
    for dir in dirs
        println(joinpath(root, dir)) # path to directories
    end
    println("Files in $root")
    for file in files
        println(joinpath(root, file)) # path to files
    end
end
```

```julia-repl
julia> mkpath("my/test/dir");

julia> itr = walkdir("my");

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my", ["test"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test", ["dir"], String[])

julia> (root, dirs, files) = first(itr)
("my/test/dir", String[], String[])
```
```
which(f, types)
```

Returns the method of `f` (a `Method` object) that would be called for arguments of the given `types`.

If `types` is an abstract type, then the method that would be called by `invoke` is returned.

See also: [`parentmodule`](@ref), and `@which` and `@edit` in [`InteractiveUtils`](@ref man-interactive-utils).

```
which(types::Type{<:Tuple})
```

Returns the method that would be called by the given type signature (as a tuple type).

```
which(module, symbol)
```

Return the module in which the binding for the variable referenced by `symbol` in `module` was created.
```
widemul(x, y)
```

Multiply `x` and `y`, giving the result as a larger type.

See also [`promote`](@ref), [`Base.add_sum`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widemul(Float32(3.0), 4.0) isa BigFloat
true

julia> typemax(Int8) * typemax(Int8)
1

julia> widemul(typemax(Int8), typemax(Int8))  # == 127^2
16129
```
```
widen(x)
```

If `x` is a type, return a "larger" type, defined so that arithmetic operations `+` and `-` are guaranteed not to overflow nor lose precision for any combination of values that type `x` can hold.

For fixed-size integer types less than 128 bits, `widen` will return a type with twice the number of bits.

If `x` is a value, it is converted to `widen(typeof(x))`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> widen(Int32)
Int64

julia> widen(1.5f0)
1.5
```
```
withenv(f, kv::Pair...)
```

Execute `f` in an environment that is temporarily modified (not replaced as in `setenv`) by zero or more `"var"=>val` arguments `kv`. `withenv` is generally used via the `withenv(kv...) do ... end` syntax. A value of `nothing` can be used to temporarily unset an environment variable (if it is set). When `withenv` returns, the original environment has been restored.
```
write(io::IO, x)
write(filename::AbstractString, x)
```

Write the canonical binary representation of a value to the given I/O stream or file. Return the number of bytes written into the stream. See also [`print`](@ref) to write a text representation (with an encoding that may depend upon `io`).

The endianness of the written value depends on the endianness of the host system. Convert to/from a fixed endianness when writing/reading (e.g. using  [`htol`](@ref) and [`ltoh`](@ref)) to get results that are consistent across platforms.

You can write multiple values with the same `write` call. i.e. the following are equivalent:

```
write(io, x, y...)
write(io, x) + write(io, y...)
```

# Examples

Consistent serialization:

```jldoctest
julia> fname = tempname(); # random temporary filename

julia> open(fname,"w") do f
           # Make sure we write 64bit integer in little-endian byte order
           write(f,htol(Int64(42)))
       end
8

julia> open(fname,"r") do f
           # Convert back to host byte order and host integer type
           Int(ltoh(read(f,Int64)))
       end
42
```

Merging write calls:

```jldoctest
julia> io = IOBuffer();

julia> write(io, "JuliaLang is a GitHub organization.", " It has many members.")
56

julia> String(take!(io))
"JuliaLang is a GitHub organization. It has many members."

julia> write(io, "Sometimes those members") + write(io, " write documentation.")
44

julia> String(take!(io))
"Sometimes those members write documentation."
```

User-defined plain-data types without `write` methods can be written when wrapped in a `Ref`:

```jldoctest
julia> struct MyStruct; x::Float64; end

julia> io = IOBuffer()
IOBuffer(data=UInt8[...], readable=true, writable=true, seekable=true, append=false, size=0, maxsize=Inf, ptr=1, mark=-1)

julia> write(io, Ref(MyStruct(42.0)))
8

julia> seekstart(io); read!(io, Ref(MyStruct(NaN)))
Base.RefValue{MyStruct}(MyStruct(42.0))
```
```
xor(x, y)
⊻(x, y)
```

Bitwise exclusive or of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊻ b` is a synonym for `xor(a,b)`, and `⊻` can be typed by tab-completing `\xor` or `\veebar` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> xor(true, false)
true

julia> xor(true, true)
false

julia> xor(true, missing)
missing

julia> false ⊻ false
false

julia> [true; true; false] .⊻ [true; false; false]
3-element BitVector:
 0
 1
 0
```
```
yield()
```

Switch to the scheduler to allow another scheduled task to run. A task that calls this function is still runnable, and will be restarted immediately if there are no other runnable tasks.

```
yield(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

A fast, unfair-scheduling version of `schedule(t, arg); yield()` which immediately yields to `t` before calling the scheduler.
```
yieldto(t::Task, arg = nothing)
```

Switch to the given task. The first time a task is switched to, the task's function is called with no arguments. On subsequent switches, `arg` is returned from the task's last call to `yieldto`. This is a low-level call that only switches tasks, not considering states or scheduling in any way. Its use is discouraged.
```
zero(x)
zero(::Type)
```

Get the additive identity element for the type of `x` (`x` can also specify the type itself).

See also [`iszero`](@ref), [`one`](@ref), [`oneunit`](@ref), [`oftype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zero(1)
0

julia> zero(big"2.0")
0.0

julia> zero(rand(2,2))
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0
```
```
zeros([T=Float64,] dims::Tuple)
zeros([T=Float64,] dims...)
```

Create an `Array`, with element type `T`, of all zeros with size specified by `dims`. See also [`fill`](@ref), [`ones`](@ref), [`zero`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> zeros(1)
1-element Vector{Float64}:
 0.0

julia> zeros(Int8, 2, 3)
2×3 Matrix{Int8}:
 0  0  0
 0  0  0
```
```
zip(iters...)
```

Run multiple iterators at the same time, until any of them is exhausted. The value type of the `zip` iterator is a tuple of values of its subiterators.

!!! note
    `zip` orders the calls to its subiterators in such a way that stateful iterators will not advance when another iterator finishes in the current iteration.

julia> a = 1:5
1:5

julia> b = ["e","d","b","c","a"]
5-element Vector{String}:
 "e"
 "d"
 "b"
 "c"
 "a"

julia> c = zip(a,b)
zip(1:5, ["e", "d", "b", "c", "a"])

julia> length(c)
5

julia> first(c)
(1, "e")
```
```
x | y
```

Bitwise or. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one operand is `missing` and the other is `false`.

See also: [`&`](@ref), [`xor`](@ref), [`||`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 4 | 10
14

julia> 4 | 1

julia> true | missing
true

julia> false | missing
missing
```
```
|>(x, f)
```

Applies a function to the preceding argument. This allows for easy function chaining.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> [1:5;] |> (x->x.^2) |> sum |> inv
0.01818181818181818
```
```
~(x)
```

Bitwise not.

div(x, y)
÷(x, y)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Generally equivalent to a mathematical operation x/y without a fractional part.

See also: [`cld`](@ref), [`fld`](@ref), [`rem`](@ref), [`divrem`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest

```

```
div(x, y, r::RoundingMode=RoundToZero)
```

The quotient from Euclidean (integer) division. Computes x/y, rounded to an integer according to the rounding mode `r`. In other words, the quantity

```
round(x/y,r)
```

without any intermediate rounding.

!!! compat "Julia 1.4"
    The three-argument method taking a `RoundingMode` requires Julia 1.4 or later.


See also [`fld`](@ref) and [`cld`](@ref), which are special cases of this function.

```
in(collection)
∈(collection)
```

Create a function that checks whether its argument is [`in`](@ref) `collection`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y in collection`. See also [`insorted`](@ref) for use with sorted collections.

The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(in)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

```
in(item, collection) -> Bool
∈(item, collection) -> Bool
```

Determine whether an item is in the given collection, in the sense that it is [`==`](@ref) to one of the values generated by iterating over the collection. Returns a `Bool` value, except if `item` is [`missing`](@ref) or `collection` contains `missing` but not `item`, in which case `missing` is returned ([three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), matching the behavior of [`any`](@ref) and [`==`](@ref)).

Some collections follow a slightly different definition. For example, [`Set`](@ref)s check whether the item [`isequal`](@ref) to one of the elements. [`Dict`](@ref)s look for `key=>value` pairs, and the key is compared using [`isequal`](@ref). To test for the presence of a key in a dictionary, use [`haskey`](@ref) or `k in keys(dict)`. For these collections, the result is always a `Bool` and never `missing`.

To determine whether an item is not in a given collection, see [`:∉`](@ref). You may also negate the `in` by doing `!(a in b)` which is logically similar to "not in".

When broadcasting with `in.(items, collection)` or `items .∈ collection`, both `item` and `collection` are broadcasted over, which is often not what is intended. For example, if both arguments are vectors (and the dimensions match), the result is a vector indicating whether each value in collection `items` is `in` the value at the corresponding position in `collection`. To get a vector indicating whether each value in `items` is in `collection`, wrap `collection` in a tuple or a `Ref` like this: `in.(items, Ref(collection))` or `items .∈ Ref(collection)`.

# Examples

julia> a = 1:3:20

sqrt(x)
```

Return $\sqrt{x}$. Throws [`DomainError`](@ref) for negative [`Real`](@ref) arguments. Use complex negative arguments instead. The prefix operator `√` is equivalent to `sqrt`.

See also: [`hypot`](@ref).

# Examples

sqrt(A::AbstractMatrix)
```

If `A` has no negative real eigenvalues, compute the principal matrix square root of `A`, that is the unique matrix $X$ with eigenvalues having positive real part such that $X^2 = A$. Otherwise, a nonprincipal square root is returned.

If `A` is real-symmetric or Hermitian, its eigendecomposition ([`eigen`](@ref)) is used to compute the square root.   For such matrices, eigenvalues λ that appear to be slightly negative due to roundoff errors are treated as if they were zero. More precisely, matrices with all eigenvalues `≥ -rtol*(max |λ|)` are treated as semidefinite (yielding a Hermitian square root), with negative eigenvalues taken to be zero. `rtol` is a keyword argument to `sqrt` (in the Hermitian/real-symmetric case only) that defaults to machine precision scaled by `size(A,1)`.

Otherwise, the square root is determined by means of the Björck-Hammarling method [^BH83], which computes the complex Schur form ([`schur`](@ref)) and then the complex square root of the triangular factor. If a real square root exists, then an extension of this method [^H87] that computes the real Schur form and then the real square root of the quasi-triangular factor is instead used.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> A = [4 0; 0 4]
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 4  0
 0  4

julia> sqrt(A)
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  0.0
 0.0  2.0
```
```
cbrt(x::Real)
```

Return the cube root of `x`, i.e. $x^{1/3}$. Negative values are accepted (returning the negative real root when $x < 0$).

The prefix operator `∛` is equivalent to `cbrt`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> cbrt(big(27))
3.0

julia> cbrt(big(-27))
-3.0
```
```
intersect(s, itrs...)
∩(s, itrs...)
```

Construct the set containing those elements which appear in all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∩` can be typed by writing `\cap` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∩ itr`.

See also [`setdiff`](@ref), [`isdisjoint`](@ref), [`issubset`](@ref Base.issubset), [`issetequal`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    As of Julia 1.8 intersect returns a result with the eltype of the type-promoted eltypes of the two inputs

```
```
union(s, itrs...)
∪(s, itrs...)
```

Construct an object containing all distinct elements from all of the arguments.

The first argument controls what kind of container is returned. If this is an array, it maintains the order in which elements first appear.

Unicode `∪` can be typed by writing `\cup` then pressing tab in the Julia REPL, and in many editors. This is an infix operator, allowing `s ∪ itr`.

```
isapprox(x, y; atol::Real=0, rtol::Real=atol>0 ? 0 : √eps, nans::Bool=false[, norm::Function])
```

Inexact equality comparison. Two numbers compare equal if their relative distance *or* their absolute distance is within tolerance bounds: `isapprox` returns `true` if `norm(x-y) <= max(atol, rtol*max(norm(x), norm(y)))`. The default `atol` is zero and the default `rtol` depends on the types of `x` and `y`. The keyword argument `nans` determines whether or not NaN values are considered equal (defaults to false).

For real or complex floating-point values, if an `atol > 0` is not specified, `rtol` defaults to the square root of [`eps`](@ref) of the type of `x` or `y`, whichever is bigger (least precise). This corresponds to requiring equality of about half of the significant digits. Otherwise, e.g. for integer arguments or if an `atol > 0` is supplied, `rtol` defaults to zero.

The `norm` keyword defaults to `abs` for numeric `(x,y)` and to `LinearAlgebra.norm` for arrays (where an alternative `norm` choice is sometimes useful). When `x` and `y` are arrays, if `norm(x-y)` is not finite (i.e. `±Inf` or `NaN`), the comparison falls back to checking whether all elements of `x` and `y` are approximately equal component-wise.

The binary operator `≈` is equivalent to `isapprox` with the default arguments, and `x ≉ y` is equivalent to `!isapprox(x,y)`.

Note that `x ≈ 0` (i.e., comparing to zero with the default tolerances) is equivalent to `x == 0` since the default `atol` is `0`.  In such cases, you should either supply an appropriate `atol` (or use `norm(x) ≤ atol`) or rearrange your code (e.g. use `x ≈ y` rather than `x - y ≈ 0`).   It is not possible to pick a nonzero `atol` automatically because it depends on the overall scaling (the "units") of your problem: for example, in `x - y ≈ 0`, `atol=1e-9` is an absurdly small tolerance if `x` is the [radius of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius) in meters, but an absurdly large tolerance if `x` is the [radius of a Hydrogen atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) in meters.

!!! compat "Julia 1.6"
    Passing the `norm` keyword argument when comparing numeric (non-array) arguments requires Julia 1.6 or later.


# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; atol=0.05)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.34)
true

julia> isapprox(0.1, 0.15; rtol=0.33)
false

julia> 0.1 + 1e-10 ≈ 0.1
true

julia> 1e-10 ≈ 0
false

julia> isapprox(1e-10, 0, atol=1e-8)
true

julia> isapprox([10.0^9, 1.0], [10.0^9, 2.0]) # using `norm`
true
```

```
isapprox(x; kwargs...) / ≈(x; kwargs...)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using `≈`, i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y ≈ x`.

The keyword arguments supported here are the same as those in the 2-argument `isapprox`.

!!! compat "Julia 1.5"
    This method requires Julia 1.5 or later.

```
!=(x, y)
≠(x,y)
```

Not-equals comparison operator. Always gives the opposite answer as [`==`](@ref).

# Implementation

New types should generally not implement this, and rely on the fallback definition `!=(x,y) = !(x==y)` instead.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> 3 != 2
true

julia> "foo" ≠ "foo"
false
```

```
!=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`!=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y != x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(!=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

!!! compat "Julia 1.2"
    This functionality requires at least Julia 1.2.

```
===(x,y) -> Bool
≡(x,y) -> Bool
```

Determine whether `x` and `y` are identical, in the sense that no program could distinguish them. First the types of `x` and `y` are compared. If those are identical, mutable objects are compared by address in memory and immutable objects (such as numbers) are compared by contents at the bit level. This function is sometimes called "egal". It always returns a `Bool` value.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2];

julia> a == b
true

julia> a === b
false

julia> a === a
true
```
```
!==(x, y)
≢(x,y)
```

Always gives the opposite answer as [`===`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2];

julia> a ≢ b
true

julia> a ≢ a
false
```
```
<=(x, y)
≤(x,y)

true

julia> "abc" ≤ "abc"
true

julia> 5 <= 3

```

```
<=(x)
```

Create a function that compares its argument to `x` using [`<=`](@ref), i.e. a function equivalent to `y -> y <= x`. The returned function is of type `Base.Fix2{typeof(<=)}`, which can be used to implement specialized methods.

true

julia> 5 >= 3
true
```

```

⊇(b, a) -> Bool
```

Determine whether every element of `a` is also in `b`, using [`in`](@ref).

See also [`⊊`](@ref), [`⊈`](@ref), [`∩`](@ref intersect), [`∪`](@ref union), [`contains`](@ref).

false

julia> [1, 2, 3] ⊇ [1, 2]
true
```
```
xor(x, y)
⊻(x, y)
```

Bitwise exclusive or of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊻ b` is a synonym for `xor(a,b)`, and `⊻` can be typed by tab-completing `\xor` or `\veebar` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

julia> xor(true, false)
true

julia> xor(true, true)
false

⊽(x, y)
```

Bitwise nor (not or) of `x` and `y`. Implements [three-valued logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-valued_logic), returning [`missing`](@ref) if one of the arguments is `missing`.

The infix operation `a ⊽ b` is a synonym for `nor(a,b)`, and `⊽` can be typed by tab-completing `\nor` or `\barvee` in the Julia REPL.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> nor(true, false)

```
===(x,y) -> Bool
≡(x,y) -> Bool
```

Determine whether `x` and `y` are identical, in the sense that no program could distinguish them. First the types of `x` and `y` are compared. If those are identical, mutable objects are compared by address in memory and immutable objects (such as numbers) are compared by contents at the bit level. This function is sometimes called "egal". It always returns a `Bool` value.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = [1, 2]; b = [1, 2];

julia> a == b
true

julia> a === b
false

julia> a === a
true
```
```
applicable(f, args...) -> Bool
```

Determine whether the given generic function has a method applicable to the given arguments.

See also [`hasmethod`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> function f(x, y)
           x + y
       end;

julia> applicable(f, 1)
false

julia> applicable(f, 1, 2)
true
```
```
eval(expr)
```

Evaluate an expression in the global scope of the containing module. Every `Module` (except those defined with `baremodule`) has its own 1-argument definition of `eval`, which evaluates expressions in that module.
```
fieldtype(T, name::Symbol | index::Int)
```

Determine the declared type of a field (specified by name or index) in a composite DataType `T`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> struct Foo
           x::Int64
           y::String
       end

julia> fieldtype(Foo, :x)
Int64

julia> fieldtype(Foo, 2)
String
```
```
getfield(value, name::Symbol, [order::Symbol])
getfield(value, i::Int, [order::Symbol])
```

Extract a field from a composite `value` by name or position. Optionally, an ordering can be defined for the operation. If the field was declared `@atomic`, the specification is strongly recommended to be compatible with the stores to that location. Otherwise, if not declared as `@atomic`, this parameter must be `:not_atomic` if specified. See also [`getproperty`](@ref Base.getproperty) and [`fieldnames`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1//2
1//2

julia> getfield(a, :num)
1

julia> a.num
1

julia> getfield(a, 1)
1
```
No documentation found.

Binding `getglobal` does not exist.
```
invoke(f, argtypes::Type, args...; kwargs...)
```

Invoke a method for the given generic function `f` matching the specified types `argtypes` on the specified arguments `args` and passing the keyword arguments `kwargs`. The arguments `args` must conform with the specified types in `argtypes`, i.e. conversion is not automatically performed. This method allows invoking a method other than the most specific matching method, which is useful when the behavior of a more general definition is explicitly needed (often as part of the implementation of a more specific method of the same function).

Be careful when using `invoke` for functions that you don't write.  What definition is used for given `argtypes` is an implementation detail unless the function is explicitly states that calling with certain `argtypes` is a part of public API.  For example, the change between `f1` and `f2` in the example below is usually considered compatible because the change is invisible by the caller with a normal (non-`invoke`) call.  However, the change is visible if you use `invoke`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> f(x::Real) = x^2;

julia> f(x::Integer) = 1 + invoke(f, Tuple{Real}, x);

julia> f(2)
5

julia> f1(::Integer) = Integer
       f1(::Real) = Real;

julia> f2(x::Real) = _f2(x)
       _f2(::Integer) = Integer
       _f2(_) = Real;

julia> f1(1)
Integer

julia> f2(1)
Integer

julia> invoke(f1, Tuple{Real}, 1)
Real

julia> invoke(f2, Tuple{Real}, 1)
Integer
```
```
isa(x, type) -> Bool
```

Determine whether `x` is of the given `type`. Can also be used as an infix operator, e.g. `x isa type`.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isa(1, Int)
true

julia> isa(1, Matrix)
false

julia> isa(1, Char)
false

julia> isa(1, Number)
true

julia> 1 isa Number
true
```
```
isdefined(m::Module, s::Symbol, [order::Symbol])
isdefined(object, s::Symbol, [order::Symbol])
isdefined(object, index::Int, [order::Symbol])
```

Tests whether a global variable or object field is defined. The arguments can be a module and a symbol or a composite object and field name (as a symbol) or index. Optionally, an ordering can be defined for the operation. If the field was declared `@atomic`, the specification is strongly recommended to be compatible with the stores to that location. Otherwise, if not declared as `@atomic`, this parameter must be `:not_atomic` if specified.

To test whether an array element is defined, use [`isassigned`](@ref) instead.

See also [`@isdefined`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> isdefined(Base, :sum)
true

julia> isdefined(Base, :NonExistentMethod)
false

julia> a = 1//2;

julia> isdefined(a, 2)
true

julia> isdefined(a, 3)
false

julia> isdefined(a, :num)
true

julia> isdefined(a, :numerator)
false
```
```
modifyfield!(value, name::Symbol, op, x, [order::Symbol]) -> Pair
modifyfield!(value, i::Int, op, x, [order::Symbol]) -> Pair
```

These atomically perform the operations to get and set a field after applying the function `op`.

```
y = getfield(value, name)
z = op(y, x)
setfield!(value, name, z)
return y => z
```

If supported by the hardware (for example, atomic increment), this may be optimized to the appropriate hardware instruction, otherwise it'll use a loop.
```
nfields(x) -> Int
```

Get the number of fields in the given object.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1//2;

julia> nfields(a)
2

julia> b = 1
1

julia> nfields(b)
0

julia> ex = ErrorException("I've done a bad thing");

julia> nfields(ex)
1
```

In these examples, `a` is a [`Rational`](@ref), which has two fields. `b` is an `Int`, which is a primitive bitstype with no fields at all. `ex` is an [`ErrorException`](@ref), which has one field.
```
replacefield!(value, name::Symbol, expected, desired,
              [success_order::Symbol, [fail_order::Symbol=success_order]) -> (; old, success::Bool)
replacefield!(value, i::Int, expected, desired,
              [success_order::Symbol, [fail_order::Symbol=success_order]) -> (; old, success::Bool)
```

These atomically perform the operations to get and conditionally set a field to a given value.

```
y = getfield(value, name, fail_order)
ok = y === expected
if ok
    setfield!(value, name, desired, success_order)
end
return (; old = y, success = ok)
```

If supported by the hardware, this may be optimized to the appropriate hardware instruction, otherwise it'll use a loop.
```
setfield!(value, name::Symbol, x, [order::Symbol])
setfield!(value, i::Int, x, [order::Symbol])
```

Assign `x` to a named field in `value` of composite type. The `value` must be mutable and `x` must be a subtype of `fieldtype(typeof(value), name)`. Additionally, an ordering can be specified for this operation. If the field was declared `@atomic`, this specification is mandatory. Otherwise, if not declared as `@atomic`, it must be `:not_atomic` if specified. See also [`setproperty!`](@ref Base.setproperty!).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> mutable struct MyMutableStruct
           field::Int
       end

julia> a = MyMutableStruct(1);

julia> setfield!(a, :field, 2);

julia> getfield(a, :field)
2

julia> a = 1//2
1//2

julia> setfield!(a, :num, 3);
ERROR: setfield!: immutable struct of type Rational cannot be changed
```
No documentation found.

Binding `setglobal!` does not exist.
```
swapfield!(value, name::Symbol, x, [order::Symbol])
swapfield!(value, i::Int, x, [order::Symbol])
```

These atomically perform the operations to simultaneously get and set a field:

```
y = getfield(value, name)
setfield!(value, name, x)
return y
```
```
throw(e)
```

Throw an object as an exception.

See also: [`rethrow`](@ref), [`error`](@ref).
```
tuple(xs...)
```

Construct a tuple of the given objects.

See also [`Tuple`](@ref), [`NamedTuple`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> tuple(1, 'b', pi)
(1, 'b', π)

julia> ans === (1, 'b', π)
true

julia> Tuple(Real[1, 2, pi])  # takes a collection
(1, 2, π)
```
```
typeassert(x, type)
```

Throw a [`TypeError`](@ref) unless `x isa type`. The syntax `x::type` calls this function.

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> typeassert(2.5, Int)
ERROR: TypeError: in typeassert, expected Int64, got a value of type Float64
Stacktrace:
[...]
```
```
typeof(x)
```

Get the concrete type of `x`.

See also [`eltype`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> a = 1//2;

julia> typeof(a)
Rational{Int64}

julia> M = [1 2; 3.5 4];

julia> typeof(M)
Matrix{Float64} (alias for Array{Float64, 2})
```
```
@code_llvm
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls [`code_llvm`](@ref) on the resulting expression. Set the optional keyword arguments `raw`, `dump_module`, `debuginfo`, `optimize` by putting them and their value before the function call, like this:

```
@code_llvm raw=true dump_module=true debuginfo=:default f(x)
@code_llvm optimize=false f(x)
```

`optimize` controls whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied. `raw` makes all metadata and dbg.* calls visible. `debuginfo` may be one of `:source` (default) or `:none`,  to specify the verbosity of code comments. `dump_module` prints the entire module that encapsulates the function.
```
@code_lowered
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls [`code_lowered`](@ref) on the resulting expression.
```
@code_native
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls [`code_native`](@ref) on the resulting expression.

Set any of the optional keyword arguments `syntax`, `debuginfo`, `binary` or `dump_module` by putting it before the function call, like this:

```
@code_native syntax=:intel debuginfo=:default binary=true dump_module=false f(x)
```

  * Set assembly syntax by setting `syntax` to `:att` (default) for AT&T syntax or `:intel` for Intel syntax.
  * Specify verbosity of code comments by setting `debuginfo` to `:source` (default) or `:none`.
  * If `binary` is `true`, also print the binary machine code for each instruction precedented by an abbreviated address.
  * If `dump_module` is `false`, do not print metadata such as rodata or directives.

```
@code_typed
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls [`code_typed`](@ref) on the resulting expression. Use the optional argument `optimize` with

```
@code_typed optimize=true foo(x)
```

to control whether additional optimizations, such as inlining, are also applied.
```
@code_warntype
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls [`code_warntype`](@ref) on the resulting expression.
```
@edit
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls the `edit` function on the resulting expression.

See also: [`@less`](@ref), [`@which`](@ref).
```
@functionloc
```

Applied to a function or macro call, it evaluates the arguments to the specified call, and returns a tuple `(filename,line)` giving the location for the method that would be called for those arguments. It calls out to the `functionloc` function.
```
@less
```

Evaluates the arguments to the function or macro call, determines their types, and calls the `less` function on the resulting expression.

See also: [`@edit`](@ref), [`@which`](@ref), [`@code_lowered`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.8"
    This macro requires at least Julia 1.8

```
@which
```

Applied to a function or macro call, it evaluates the arguments to the specified call, and returns the `Method` object for the method that would be called for those arguments. Applied to a variable, it returns the module in which the variable was bound. It calls out to the [`which`](@ref) function.

See also: [`@less`](@ref), [`@edit`](@ref).
```
apropos([io::IO=stdout], pattern::Union{AbstractString,Regex})
```

Search available docstrings for entries containing `pattern`.

When `pattern` is a string, case is ignored. Results are printed to `io`.

`apropos` can be called from the help mode in the REPL by wrapping the query in double quotes:

```
help?> "pattern"
```
```
clipboard(x)
```

Send a printed form of `x` to the operating system clipboard ("copy").

```
clipboard() -> AbstractString
```

Return a string with the contents of the operating system clipboard ("paste").
```
code_llvm([io=stdout,], f, types; raw=false, dump_module=false, optimize=true, debuginfo=:default)
```

Prints the LLVM bitcodes generated for running the method matching the given generic function and type signature to `io`.

If the `optimize` keyword is unset, the code will be shown before LLVM optimizations. All metadata and dbg.* calls are removed from the printed bitcode. For the full IR, set the `raw` keyword to true. To dump the entire module that encapsulates the function (with declarations), set the `dump_module` keyword to true. Keyword argument `debuginfo` may be one of source (default) or none, to specify the verbosity of code comments.
```
code_native([io=stdout,], f, types; syntax=:att, debuginfo=:default, binary=false, dump_module=true)
```

Prints the native assembly instructions generated for running the method matching the given generic function and type signature to `io`.

  * Set assembly syntax by setting `syntax` to `:att` (default) for AT&T syntax or `:intel` for Intel syntax.
  * Specify verbosity of code comments by setting `debuginfo` to `:source` (default) or `:none`.
  * If `binary` is `true`, also print the binary machine code for each instruction precedented by an abbreviated address.
  * If `dump_module` is `false`, do not print metadata such as rodata or directives.

```
code_warntype([io::IO], f, types; debuginfo=:default)
```

Prints lowered and type-inferred ASTs for the methods matching the given generic function and type signature to `io` which defaults to `stdout`. The ASTs are annotated in such a way as to cause "non-leaf" types to be emphasized (if color is available, displayed in red). This serves as a warning of potential type instability. Not all non-leaf types are particularly problematic for performance, so the results need to be used judiciously. In particular, unions containing either [`missing`](@ref) or [`nothing`](@ref) are displayed in yellow, since these are often intentional.

Keyword argument `debuginfo` may be one of `:source` or `:none` (default), to specify the verbosity of code comments.

See [`@code_warntype`](@ref man-code-warntype) for more information.
```
edit(path::AbstractString, line::Integer=0)
```

Edit a file or directory optionally providing a line number to edit the file at. Return to the `julia` prompt when you quit the editor. The editor can be changed by setting `JULIA_EDITOR`, `VISUAL` or `EDITOR` as an environment variable.

See also [`define_editor`](@ref).

```
edit(function, [types])
edit(module)
```

Edit the definition of a function, optionally specifying a tuple of types to indicate which method to edit. For modules, open the main source file. The module needs to be loaded with `using` or `import` first.

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    `edit` on modules requires at least Julia 1.1.


To ensure that the file can be opened at the given line, you may need to call `define_editor` first.
```
less(file::AbstractString, [line::Integer])
```

Show a file using the default pager, optionally providing a starting line number. Returns to the `julia` prompt when you quit the pager.

```
less(function, [types])
```

Show the definition of a function using the default pager, optionally specifying a tuple of types to indicate which method to see.
```
methodswith(typ[, module or function]; supertypes::Bool=false])
```

Return an array of methods with an argument of type `typ`.

The optional second argument restricts the search to a particular module or function (the default is all top-level modules).

If keyword `supertypes` is `true`, also return arguments with a parent type of `typ`, excluding type `Any`.
```
peakflops(n::Integer=2000; parallel::Bool=false)
```

`peakflops` computes the peak flop rate of the computer by using double precision [`gemm!`](@ref LinearAlgebra.BLAS.gemm!). For more information see [`LinearAlgebra.peakflops`](@ref).

!!! compat "Julia 1.1"
    This function will be moved from `InteractiveUtils` to `LinearAlgebra` in the future. In Julia 1.1 and later it is available as `LinearAlgebra.peakflops`.

```
subtypes(T::DataType)
```

Return a list of immediate subtypes of DataType `T`. Note that all currently loaded subtypes are included, including those not visible in the current module.

See also [`supertype`](@ref), [`supertypes`](@ref), [`methodswith`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> subtypes(Integer)
3-element Vector{Any}:
 Bool
 Signed
 Unsigned
```
```
supertypes(T::Type)
```

Return a tuple `(T, ..., Any)` of `T` and all its supertypes, as determined by successive calls to the [`supertype`](@ref) function, listed in order of `<:` and terminated by `Any`.

See also [`subtypes`](@ref).

# Examples

```jldoctest
julia> supertypes(Int)
(Int64, Signed, Integer, Real, Number, Any)
```
```
varinfo(m::Module=Main, pattern::Regex=r""; all::Bool = false, imported::Bool = false, sortby::Symbol = :name, minsize::Int = 0)
```

Return a markdown table giving information about exported global variables in a module, optionally restricted to those matching `pattern`.

The memory consumption estimate is an approximate lower bound on the size of the internal structure of the object.

  * `all` : also list non-exported objects defined in the module, deprecated objects, and compiler-generated objects.
  * `imported` : also list objects explicitly imported from other modules.
  * `recursive` : recursively include objects in sub-modules, observing the same settings in each.
  * `sortby` : the column to sort results by. Options are `:name` (default), `:size`, and `:summary`.
  * `minsize` : only includes objects with size at least `minsize` bytes. Defaults to `0`.
```
versioninfo(io::IO=stdout; verbose::Bool=false)
```

Print information about the version of Julia in use. The output is controlled with boolean keyword arguments:

  * `verbose`: print all additional information

!!! warning
    The output of this function may contain sensitive information. Before sharing the output, please review the output and remove any data that should not be shared publicly.
